## 1. Informal Workers - "The Education Cascade"

**Population**: 1,330 informal workers (20% of survey)
**Key Characteristic**: No employment contracts, no benefits, precarious work

### The Health Inequality Pattern

Among Bangkok's informal workers, health outcomes follow a clear cascade: **education determines income, income determines healthcare access, and healthcare access determines disease outcomes.** But this population also shows unique protective factors that don't exist for other groups.

---

### Pathway 1: Education as the Master Key (30% of health influence)

**The divide**:
- Primary education only: **53.1% chronic disease**
- Bachelor+ education: **30.1% chronic disease**
- **Gap: 23.0 percentage points** (r=-0.217, p<0.001)

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Primary or less | 53.1% | n varies |
| Bachelor+ | 30.1% | n varies |
| **Gap** | **-23.0 pp** | p<0.001, r=-0.217 |

**Why education matters so much**:

Education isn't just about knowledge—it **unlocks multiple downstream pathways**:

1. **Income pathway**: Bachelor+ workers earn **25,557 baht/month** vs primary-educated workers at **13,900 baht/month** (84% income gap, 1.84× multiplier)

| Education Level | Monthly Income | Income Gap |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Primary or less | 13,900 baht | — |
| Bachelor+ | 25,557 baht | +11,657 baht (84% higher) |
| **Multiplier** | **1.84×** | p<0.001 |

2. **Health behavior pathway**: Educated workers exercise regularly at **29.2%** vs **15.7%** for primary-educated (13.6 pp gap)

| Education Level | Exercise Regularly | Gap |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 15.7% | — |
| Bachelor+ | 29.2% | +13.6 pp |
| **Difference** | — | p<0.001 |

3. **Homeownership pathway**: Education enables homeownership even in informal sector (+10.7 pp, p=0.026)

| Education Level | Homeownership Rate |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Primary or less | — |
| Bachelor+ | +10.7 pp higher |
| **Effect** | p=0.026 |

4. **Health literacy pathway**: Understanding symptoms, knowing when to seek care, preventive behaviors

**The cascade begins here**: Without education, informal workers earn less. With less money, their health suffers through multiple mechanisms.

*Education influence: 30% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 2: Income Determines Healthcare Access (20% of health influence)

**The economic barrier**:

Consider a typical scenario: Chest pain strikes. Medical visit costs 500 baht. Lost work time costs 800 baht. Total: 1,300 baht—nearly 10% of monthly income for low-income informal workers.

**The result**:
- Low-income informal workers: **49.4% skip needed medical care**
- Higher-income workers: **18.7% skip care**
- **Gap: 30.7 percentage points** (p<0.001)

| Income Level | Skip Needed Medical Care | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----|
| Low income (Q1) | 49.4% | — |
| Higher income (Q4) | 18.7% | -30.7 pp |
| **Difference** | **2.6× higher rate** | p<0.001 |

**Disease burden by income**:
- Lowest income (Q1): **47.6% chronic disease**
- Highest income (Q4): **36.1% chronic disease**
- **Gap: 11.5 percentage points** (r=-0.091, p<0.001)

| Income Quartile | Chronic Disease Rate | Gap |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Q1 (Lowest) | 47.6% | — |
| Q4 (Highest) | 36.1% | -11.5 pp |
| **Effect** | — | r=-0.091, p<0.001 |

**The pattern**: By the time low-income workers finally seek care (often in crisis), conditions have progressed to severe stages requiring expensive treatment they cannot afford.

*Income influence: 20% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 3: Environmental Exposure Multiplies Risk (15% of health influence)

**Geography of poverty**:

Low income doesn't just limit healthcare—it traps informal workers in multi-hazard zones.

**Environmental exposure by income**:
- Low-income workers: **85.7% live in disaster zones**
- High-income workers: **67.4% in disaster zones**
- **Gap: 18.3 percentage points** (p<0.001)

| Income Level | Live in Disaster Zones | Gap |
|-------------|----------------------|-----|
| Low income (Q1) | 85.7% | — |
| High income (Q4) | 67.4% | -18.3 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p<0.001 |

**What "disaster zones" means**:
- Flooding during rainy season (2-3 times per year)
- Extreme heat islands (no air conditioning, 38°C+ indoor temperatures)
- Air pollution (proximity to highways, industrial areas)
- Disease outbreaks (crowded conditions, poor sanitation)

**Housing overcrowding**:
- Renters: **39.7% overcrowded**
- Homeowners: **27.5% overcrowded**
- **Gap: 12.2 pp** (p=0.002)

| Housing Status | Overcrowding Rate | Gap |
|---------------|------------------|-----|
| Renters | 39.7% | — |
| Homeowners | 27.5% | -12.2 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p=0.002 |

**Homeownership paradox**: Even those who achieve homeownership face a trade-off—affordable homes concentrate in disaster-prone areas (+4.5 pp more disaster exposure, p=0.013).

| Housing Status | Disaster Zone Exposure |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Homeowners | +4.5 pp vs renters |
| **Paradox** | p=0.013 |

*Environment influence: 15% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 4: The Unique Protection—Exercise Works (12% of health influence)

**The remarkable finding**:

Among informal workers who exercise regularly:
- **35.1% have chronic disease**

Among those who don't exercise:
- **49.3% have chronic disease**

**Gap: 14.2 percentage points** (r=-0.121, p<0.001)

| Exercise Behavior | Chronic Disease Rate | Gap |
|------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Exercise regularly | 35.1% | — |
| No exercise | 49.3% | +14.2 pp |
| **Effect** | — | r=-0.121, p<0.001 |

**This protection exists ONLY for informal workers.** Not for elderly, not for LGBT+, not even the general population.

**Why exercise uniquely protects informal workers**:
- Counteracts physical toll of long hours standing
- Reduces impact of poor ergonomics
- Mitigates chronic work stress
- Compensates for lack of occupational health protections

**Education drives exercise adoption**:
- Bachelor+: **29.2%** exercise regularly
- Primary: **15.7%** exercise regularly
- **Gap: 13.6 pp** (p<0.001)

| Education Level | Exercise Regularly | Gap |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 15.7% | — |
| Bachelor+ | 29.2% | +13.6 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p<0.001 |

*Exercise influence: 12% of total health impact (UNIQUE PROTECTIVE FACTOR)*

---

### Pathway 5: Employment Stress Manifests as Smoking (8% of health influence)

**The stress marker**:

Informal workers show **16.2% regular smoking** (not occasional—daily, habitual) compared to **10.0%** among general population (+6.2 pp, p<0.001).

| Population Group | Regular Smoking Rate | Gap |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Informal workers | 16.2% | — |
| General population | 10.0% | -6.2 pp |
| **Effect** | **HIGHEST rate** | p<0.001 |

**Why smoking rates are elevated**:
- No employment contracts = zero job security
- Income varies wildly week to week
- No workplace smoking restrictions
- No employer health insurance
- Cigarettes more affordable than healthcare

**Smoking is a visible sign that informal employment conditions create chronic stress**, not a cause of health problems but a symptom of precarious work.

*Smoking influence: 8% of total health impact (STRESS INDICATOR)*

---

### Pathway 6: Social Networks Provide Unexpected Protection (10% of health influence)

**The silver lining**:

Despite economic vulnerability, informal workers show **stronger social protection** than the general population.

**Violence exposure**:
- Informal workers: **10.2%**
- General population: **24.0%**
- **Gap: -13.7 pp** (57% lower risk, p<0.001)

| Population Group | Violence Exposure | Gap |
|-----------------|------------------|-----|
| Informal workers | 10.2% | — |
| General population | 24.0% | +13.7 pp |
| **Protection** | **57% lower risk** | p<0.001 |

**Emergency support networks**:
- Informal workers: **89.9% have someone to call** in crisis
- General population: **84.1%**
- **Gap: +5.8 pp** (p<0.001)

| Population Group | Has Emergency Support | Gap |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Informal workers | 89.9% | — |
| General population | 84.1% | -5.8 pp |
| **Protection** | **Stronger support** | p<0.001 |

**Discrimination**:
- Informal workers: **13.7%**
- General population: **17.6%**
- **Gap: -3.9 pp** (p=0.004)
- Type: Primarily economic discrimination (8.0%)

| Population Group | Discrimination Rate | Gap |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Informal workers | 13.7% | — |
| General population | 17.6% | +3.9 pp |
| **Protection** | **Lower exposure** | p=0.004 |

**Why social networks are strong**:
- Tight-knit communities (neighbors, family, fellow vendors)
- Shared economic circumstances create solidarity
- Less exposure to workplace discrimination (compared to formal sector)
- Community mutual aid systems

**These networks don't fix income or health, but they buffer against violence and isolation.**

*Social protection: 10% of total health impact (PROTECTIVE BUFFER)*

---

### The Complete Picture: Informal Workers' Health Destiny

| Factor | Influence | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Education** | **30%** | Master key unlocking income, exercise, health literacy, homeownership |
| **Income** | **20%** | Determines healthcare access, housing quality, environmental exposure |
| **Environment** | **15%** | Poverty traps workers in multi-hazard zones (flood, heat, pollution) |
| **Exercise** | **12%** | UNIQUE protective factor—only group where exercise reduces disease |
| **Social Networks** | **10%** | Community protection buffers violence and provides crisis support |
| **Smoking** | **8%** | Stress marker indicating employment precarity toll |
| **Housing** | **5%** | Overcrowding spreads disease; affordable areas in disaster zones |

**Summary**: Education drives the entire cascade for informal workers, creating an 84% income gap that determines healthcare access, environmental exposure, and ultimately disease outcomes. However, exercise provides unique protection (14.2 pp disease reduction), and strong social networks buffer violence exposure by 57%. Smoking serves as a visible stress marker showing the psychological toll of precarious employment.

## 2. Elderly Population - "Lifetime Choices, Current Consequences"

**Population**: 2,964 elderly (60+ years, 45% of survey)
**Key Characteristic**: Near-universal disease burden (88%), age-driven health decline

### The Health Inequality Pattern

For Bangkok's elderly, **the past matters more than the present**. Lifetime employment history (contract vs no contract) determines current income more than education. But the **biggest modifiable health threat isn't socioeconomic—it's the air they breathe every day**. At 68 years old, income can't prevent disease (age dominates), but it determines quality of life through symptom management.

---

### Pathway 1: Air Pollution—The Invisible Killer (25% of health influence)

**The strongest environmental effect in the entire study**:

**Elderly exposed to air pollution disasters**:
- **64.9% experience health symptoms** (coughing, wheezing, respiratory distress)

**Elderly NOT exposed**:
- **21.3% have symptoms**

**Gap: 43.6 percentage points** (r=0.440, p<0.001)

| Air Pollution Exposure | Health Symptoms | Gap |
|----------------------|----------------|-----|
| Exposed to air pollution | 64.9% | — |
| NOT exposed | 21.3% | -43.6 pp |
| **Effect** | **STRONGEST in study** | r=0.440, p<0.001 |

**Why this effect is so massive**:
- Correlation coefficient r=0.440 is **EXTREMELY STRONG** for epidemiological research
- Represents decades of cumulative exposure compounding
- Elderly have weakened immune systems, pre-existing respiratory conditions
- 88% already have chronic disease, pollution exacerbates symptoms

**Economic barrier to protection**:
- Air purifiers cost 3,000-15,000 baht (20-100% of monthly income)
- Cannot afford relocation to cleaner areas
- Low-income elderly depend on family housing (limited choice)

**Perception gap**: Many elderly attribute symptoms to "aging" rather than environmental exposure, preventing protective behaviors.

*Air pollution: 25% of total health impact (STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT)*

---

### Pathway 2: Lifetime Employment Contracts Matter More Than Education (20% of health influence)

**The contract dividend**:

Among elderly, **employment contract history** during working years determines retirement income more powerfully than education.

**Income by contract status**:
- With employment contract: **20,709 baht/month**
- Without contract: **14,207 baht/month**
- **Gap: 6,502 baht/month (46% premium)** (p<0.0001)

| Contract Status (During Working Years) | Current Monthly Income | Gap |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----|
| Had employment contract | 20,709 baht | — |
| No contract | 14,207 baht | -6,502 baht |
| **Premium** | **46% higher** | p<0.0001 |

**Education's weaker effect for elderly**:
- Bachelor+ elderly: 1.43× income multiplier
- **Contract status gives bigger boost than education**

**Education → Contracts pathway**:
- Bachelor+ elderly: **24.0% had contracts** during working years
- Primary educated: **4.0% had contracts**
- **Gap: 20.0 pp** (p=0.0005)

| Education Level | Had Employment Contract | Gap |
|----------------|------------------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 4.0% | — |
| Bachelor+ | 24.0% | +20.0 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p=0.0005 |

**Why contracts matter more**:
- Contracts provided social security benefits, pensions
- Lifetime wealth accumulation from stable employment
- Education matters, but **contract status was the mechanism** for economic security

**Implication**: For elderly, **the die was cast decades ago**—whether they had formal employment contracts during their working years determined their current economic situation.

*Employment contracts (lifetime): 20% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 3: Income Manages Disease, Doesn't Prevent It (18% of health influence)

**The disease management gap**:

Both low-income and high-income elderly have chronic disease (88% overall). But their **quality of life differs dramatically**.

**Healthcare access by income**:
- Low-income elderly: **43.6% skip needed medical care**
- Higher-income elderly: **12.7% skip care**
- **Gap: 30.9 pp** (3.4× higher skipping rate, p<0.001)

| Income Level | Skip Needed Medical Care | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----|
| Low income (Q1) | 43.6% | — |
| Higher income (Q4) | 12.7% | -30.9 pp |
| **Effect** | **3.4× higher rate** | p<0.001 |

**What skipping care means**:
- Cannot afford medications (1,200 baht/month for diabetes/hypertension)
- Delay checkups (500 baht + transportation)
- Skip recommended tests (blood sugar monitors: 2,800 baht)

**The paradox**:
- **Income doesn't prevent disease at age 68. Age dominates.**
- BUT income determines: Quality of life, symptom control, complication prevention, dignity

**High-income elderly**: Manage symptoms, take medications, see specialists, monitor conditions
**Low-income elderly**: Suffer through symptoms, delay care until crisis, experience complications

*Income/Healthcare: 18% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 4: Education's Lifetime Effects (15% of health influence)

**The long tail of education**:

Education matters for elderly, but through **different mechanisms** than for younger groups.

**Exercise behavior (health consciousness)**:
- Bachelor+ elderly: **38.8% exercise regularly**
- Primary educated: **16.7% exercise**
- **Gap: 22.1 pp** (p<0.001)—**STRONGEST education-exercise relationship of any group**

**Disease prevalence**:
- Primary educated: **64.0% chronic disease**
- Bachelor+ educated: **49.9% chronic disease**
- **Gap: 14.1 pp** (r=-0.119, p<0.001)

**Homeownership (wealth accumulation)**:
- Bachelor+ elderly: **76.2% own homes**
- Primary educated: **41.1% own homes**
- **Gap: 35.1 pp** (p<0.001)

**The twist**: Exercise doesn't reduce disease for elderly (p=0.893). Why? **Age overwhelms everything.**

**Education's value for elderly isn't disease prevention—it's**:
- Health literacy (recognizing symptoms, seeking appropriate care)
- Exercise habits (maintaining mobility, preventing functional decline)
- Wealth accumulation (higher homeownership from lifetime higher earnings)
- Social capital (educated children who provide support)

*Education: 15% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 5: The Housing Paradox—Choosing Access Over Space (8% of health influence)

**The counterintuitive finding**:

Researchers expected: Higher income → Larger homes → Less overcrowding

**Reality**:
- **HIGH-income elderly**: **48.1% overcrowded**
- **LOW-income elderly**: **37.6% overcrowded**
- **REVERSE gap: +10.4 pp** (p=0.006)

**What's happening**:

High-income elderly **deliberately choose** small apartments in dense central areas because:
- 5-10 minutes to hospitals
- Pharmacy nearby
- Public transit access
- Grocery delivery available
- Healthcare proximity matters more than space

Low-income elderly live in larger peripheral homes because:
- It's all they could afford
- Healthcare is 45+ minutes away
- No public transit access
- Depend on children for transportation
- **Space doesn't compensate for healthcare distance**

**Renters vs owners**:
- Renters: **51.4% overcrowded**
- Homeowners: **32.4% overcrowded**
- **Gap: 19.0 pp** (p<0.001)

**Insight**: When you're 68 with chronic disease requiring regular care, **proximity to healthcare is more valuable than square meters**.

*Housing: 8% of total health impact (PARADOXICAL PATTERN)*

---

### Pathway 6: Strongest Social Protection of Any Group (12% of health influence)

**The safety of age**:

Elderly enjoy **exceptional social protection** across all metrics.

**Violence exposure (LOWEST)**:
- Elderly: **3.8%**
- General population: **24.0%**
- **Gap: -20.1 pp** (84% lower risk, p<0.001)

**Emergency support networks (HIGHEST)**:
- Elderly: **95.1%** have emergency support
- General population: **84.1%**
- **Gap: +11.0 pp** (p<0.001)

**Discrimination (LOWEST)**:
- Elderly: **8.5%**
- General population: **17.6%**
- **Gap: -9.1 pp** (p<0.001)
- Types: Economic (5.4%), Age (2.6%)

**Cultural foundation**:
- Thai cultural value: กตัญญู (gratitude/respect for elders)
- Strong family ties (children care for aging parents)
- Less exposure to conflict-prone environments (no workplace, less nightlife)
- Community respect provides buffer

**When discrimination occurs, consequences appear**:
- Elderly WITH discrimination: **19.8% smoke**
- Elderly WITHOUT discrimination: **13.2% smoke**
- **Gap: +6.6 pp** (p=0.005)—discrimination drives stress-coping even at 68

*Social protection: 12% of total health impact (STRONGEST OF ALL GROUPS)*

---

### Evidence Note: The Smoking Paradox (Reverse Causation)

**Apparent finding**:
- Current smokers: **79.9% chronic disease**
- Non-smokers/Quit: **89.2% chronic disease**
- Gap: -9.4 pp (p<0.001)

**Wait—smokers appear healthier?**

**No. This is reverse causation**:
1. Individual smokes for 40 years
2. Gets diagnosed with COPD/heart disease at age 65
3. Doctor strongly advises: "Quit or you'll die"
4. Patient quits immediately
5. Survey captures them as "non-smoker WITH disease"
6. Those still smoking haven't received diagnosis yet (healthier)

**This paradox is strongest for elderly** because:
- Large sample (n=2,343)
- High disease prevalence (88%)
- Strong medical cessation advice
- High cessation compliance

*This tells us about medical practice and survey methodology, not smoking's health effects.*

---

### The Complete Picture: Elderly Health Destiny

| Factor | Influence | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Air Pollution** | **25%** | Strongest environmental effect (r=0.440); major modifiable risk |
| **Employment Contracts (Lifetime)** | **20%** | Contract status during working years determines retirement income |
| **Income/Healthcare** | **18%** | Manages symptoms, prevents complications; doesn't prevent disease (age dominates) |
| **Education** | **15%** | Lifetime health literacy, exercise habits, wealth accumulation, homeownership |
| **Social Protection** | **12%** | Safest group: cultural respect, strong family, lowest violence/discrimination |
| **Housing Paradox** | **8%** | High-income elderly trade space for healthcare access in dense areas |
| **Discrimination→Stress** | **2%** | Small but significant: discrimination triggers smoking as stress-coping |

**Summary**: For Bangkok's elderly, lifetime employment contracts determined economic security more than education, but their biggest current health threat is air pollution (r=0.440, 43.6 pp symptom gap). Income manages disease quality but can't prevent it (age dominates). High-income elderly paradoxically live in more crowded conditions because they prioritize healthcare proximity over space. Cultural respect provides exceptional social protection (84% lower violence, highest support networks).

---

## 3. LGBT+ Community - "When Traditional Pathways Break"

**Population**: 685 LGBT+ individuals (11% of survey)
**Key Characteristic**: Structural discrimination eliminates normal SDHE pathways

### The Health Inequality Pattern

For Bangkok's LGBT+ community, **education doesn't work**. A Bachelor's degree provides **zero** income returns, **zero** health benefits, **zero** behavioral improvements. Discrimination has severed every normal connection between education and life outcomes, leaving income as the only functioning lever—but income itself is double-edged, simultaneously enabling safety and harmful coping. The community is trapped in vicious cycles where discrimination, smoking, and violence reinforce each other.

---

### Pathway 1: Structural Discrimination—The Root Cause (35% of health influence)

**The foundation that eliminates all others**:

**LGBT+ discrimination rates**:
- LGBT+ community: **39.1% experience discrimination**
- General population: **17.6%**
- **Gap: +21.6 pp** (2.2× higher rate)

| Population Group | Discrimination Rate | Gap |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| LGBT+ community | 39.1% | — |
| General population | 17.6% | -21.6 pp |
| **Effect** | **2.2× higher** | — |

**Type of discrimination**:
- **Gender-based: 38.1%** (97% of total discrimination)
- This is **11 times higher** than general population gender discrimination (3.5%)
- Economic: 8.6%
- Religion: 8.0%
- Age: 7.3%

| Discrimination Type | LGBT+ Rate | General Pop Rate | Multiplier |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Gender-based | 38.1% | 3.5% | **11× higher** |
| Economic | 8.6% | — | — |
| Religion | 8.0% | — | — |
| Age | 7.3% | — | — |

**The pervasiveness**: 38.1 out of 39.1 total discrimination is gender-based—revealing that LGBT+ discrimination experiences are **fundamentally about gender identity/expression**, not other characteristics.

**What discrimination does**: Watch how it **breaks every normal pathway**:

*Structural discrimination: 35% of total health impact (ROOT CAUSE)*

---

### Pathway 2: Education Provides Zero Benefits (0% of health influence)

**The broken promise of education**:

Among LGBT+ individuals, education has **NO EFFECT** on any life outcome.

### **Education → Income: ZERO EFFECT**

- Bachelor+ LGBT+: **26,848 baht/month**
- Primary educated LGBT+: **27,000 baht/month**
- **Difference: -152 baht** (Bachelor degree earns LESS)
- **Income multiplier: 0.99×** (p=0.993, no relationship)

| Education Level | Monthly Income | Gap |
|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 27,000 baht | — |
| Bachelor+ | 26,848 baht | -152 baht |
| **Multiplier** | **0.99× (ZERO)** | p=0.993 |

**For comparison**:
- Disabled: **2.84×** income for education
- Informal workers: **1.84×** income
- General population: **1.5×** income
- **LGBT+: 0.99×—education buys NOTHING**

| Population Group | Education Income Multiplier |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Disabled | 2.84× |
| Informal workers | 1.84× |
| General population | 1.5× |
| **LGBT+** | **0.99× (BROKEN)** |

### **Education → Chronic Disease: ZERO EFFECT**

- Primary educated LGBT+: **45.9% chronic disease**
- Bachelor+ educated LGBT+: **37.5% chronic disease**
- **Gap: 8.4 pp** (NOT significant, r=-0.026, p=0.498)
- **Education provides NO health protection**

### **Education → Exercise: ZERO EFFECT**

- Bachelor+ LGBT+: **30.0% exercise regularly**
- Primary educated LGBT+: **27.0% exercise**
- **Gap: 3.0 pp** (NOT significant, p=0.857)
- **Education doesn't improve health behaviors**

**Why this complete breakdown?**

**Discrimination in hiring**: Employers discriminate regardless of qualifications, eliminating economic returns

**Occupational segregation**: LGBT+ individuals concentrated in low-wage sectors despite education

**Discrimination in social settings**: Limits health-promoting social networks that typically come with education

**Result**: A Bachelor's degree is worthless when employers won't hire you, landlords won't rent to you, and society won't accept you.

*Education: 0% influence (COMPLETE BREAKDOWN)*

---

### Pathway 3: Income—The Only Lever, But Double-Edged (25% of health influence)

When LGBT+ individuals gain income, **two opposite effects occur simultaneously**:

### ✅ **PROTECTIVE EFFECTS**

**Housing escape**:
- Low-income LGBT+: **34.4% overcrowding**
- High-income LGBT+: **9.2% overcrowding**
- **Gap: -25.2 pp** (p<0.001)

| Income Level | Overcrowding Rate | Gap |
|-------------|------------------|-----|
| Low income | 34.4% | — |
| High income | 9.2% | -25.2 pp |
| **Protection** | **73% reduction** | p<0.001 |

**Renters vs homeowners**:
- Renters: **22.0% overcrowding**
- Homeowners: **4.9% overcrowding**
- **Gap: -17.1 pp** (p<0.001)

| Housing Status | Overcrowding Rate | Gap |
|---------------|------------------|-----|
| Renters | 22.0% | — |
| Homeowners | 4.9% | -17.1 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p<0.001 |

**Healthcare access**:
- Low-income LGBT+: **62.5% skip needed care** (MAJORITY!)
- Higher-income LGBT+: **42.7% skip care**
- **Gap: -19.8 pp** (p=0.043)

| Income Level | Skip Needed Care | Gap |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| Low income | 62.5% | — |
| High income | 42.7% | -19.8 pp |
| **Effect** | — | p=0.043 |

**Income is the ONLY functioning protective factor for LGBT+ individuals.**

---

### ⚠️ **HARMFUL EFFECTS**

**Drinking behavior (UNIQUE—only group showing this)**:
- High-income LGBT+: **52.8% drink alcohol**
- Low-income LGBT+: **25.0% drink**
- **Gap: +27.8 pp, 2.1× higher rate** (p=0.004)

| Income Level | Alcohol Consumption | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| Low income | 25.0% | — |
| High income | 52.8% | +27.8 pp |
| **Effect** | **2.1× higher** | p=0.004 |

**Why**: Resources enable access to gay-friendly bars, social drinking culture in LGBT+ spaces, alcohol as discrimination-coping mechanism, affordability enables the behavior

**This income-drinking relationship exists ONLY for LGBT+ individuals.** No other group shows it.

**Violence exposure paradox**:
- High-income LGBT+: **31.9% experience violence**
- Low-income LGBT+: **9.4% experience violence**
- **Gap: +22.5 pp** (p=0.013)

| Income Level | Violence Exposure | Gap |
|-------------|------------------|-----|
| Low income | 9.4% | — |
| High income | 31.9% | +22.5 pp |
| **Paradox** | **3.4× higher** | p=0.013 |

**Why**:
- Higher income = formal employment = workplace visibility = more discrimination/violence
- Can afford to be "out" in public = more exposure to hostile encounters
- Low-income LGBT+ maintain "invisibility" as survival strategy
- Economic resources buy visibility that attracts violence

**The double edge**: Income enables safety (housing, healthcare) but also visibility (workplace exposure, social presence) that increases violence risk.

*Income: 25% of total health impact (ONLY FUNCTIONING LEVER, BUT DOUBLE-EDGED)*

---

### Pathway 4: The Vicious Cycle—Discrimination ↔ Smoking ↔ Violence (20% of health influence)

**A bidirectional feedback loop unique to LGBT+ lives**:

### **Discrimination → Smoking** (stress-coping)

- LGBT+ WITH discrimination: **22.8% smoke**
- LGBT+ WITHOUT discrimination: **14.6% smoke**
- **Gap: +8.1 pp** (p=0.009)

**Mechanism**: Smoking as stress relief from discrimination experiences

---

### **Smoking → Discrimination** (bidirectional!)

- LGBT+ who smoke: **50.0% experience discrimination**
- LGBT+ non-smokers: **36.8% experience discrimination**
- **Gap: +13.2 pp** (p=0.009)

**Mechanism**:
- Smoking spaces = social exposure = visibility
- Masculine-coded behavior (for trans women) = gender policing
- Smoking creates contexts where discrimination occurs

---

### **Smoking → Violence** (UNIQUE to LGBT+)

No other population group shows this pattern:

- LGBT+ smokers: **49.2% experience violence**
- LGBT+ non-smokers: **37.3% experience violence**
- **Gap: +11.9 pp** (p=0.020)

**Mechanism**: Smoking involves exposure to public/social spaces where violence occurs

---

### **The Vicious Cycle**:

```
Discrimination (39.1% rate)
      ↓
Smoking as stress-coping (+8.1 pp)
      ↓
Smoking increases discrimination visibility (+13.2 pp)
      ↓
Smoking increases violence exposure (+11.9 pp)
      ↓
Violence/discrimination increase stress
      ↓
More smoking to cope
      ↓
(Cycle reinforces and repeats)
```

**Each element reinforces the others, creating a self-perpetuating trap.**

*Vicious cycle: 20% of total health impact (BIDIRECTIONAL FEEDBACK LOOP)*

---

### Pathway 5: Violence & Social Isolation (10% total influence)

**Compound vulnerability**:

**Violence exposure (HIGHEST of all groups)**:
- LGBT+ community: **39.4% experience any violence**
- General population: **24.0%**
- **Gap: +15.5 pp**
- Psychological violence: **29.2%** (+12.0 pp)
- Physical violence: **13.1%** (+7.1 pp)

**Emergency support networks (ONLY group below general)**:
- LGBT+: **82.6% have emergency support**
- General population: **84.1%**
- **Gap: -1.5 pp** (not statistically significant, but directionally concerning)

**Why support networks are weaker**:
- Some LGBT+ individuals rejected by families
- Fewer traditional family support structures
- Discrimination limits access to mainstream support systems
- Community support exists but is weaker than family-based networks in other groups

**The compound effect**: Highest violence exposure + weakest support networks = vulnerability without buffers

*Housing (10%) + Social isolation (5%) = 15% total influence*

---

### Pathway 6: Healthcare Access—Even Money Doesn't Fix It (5% of health influence)

**Chronic disease prevalence**: **40%** of LGBT+ community

**But nothing protects them**:
- Exercise: No effect (p=0.364)
- Education: No effect (p=0.498)
- Income: No direct health effect

**Healthcare access by income**:
- Low-income LGBT+: **62.5% skip needed care** (MAJORITY!)
- Higher-income LGBT+: **42.7% skip care**
- **Even with money, 43% still can't access care**

**Why healthcare access fails even with resources**:
- Discrimination in healthcare settings (providers, staff)
- Fear of judgment or inappropriate questions
- Lack of gender-affirming care options
- Medical gatekeeping (trans-specific healthcare)
- Psychological barrier to seeking care after discrimination experiences

*Healthcare: 5% of total health impact*

---

### The Complete Picture: LGBT+ Health Destiny

| Factor | Influence | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Structural Discrimination** | **35%** | Root cause eliminating ALL normal protective mechanisms; 11× gender discrimination |
| **Income (Double-Edged)** | **25%** | ONLY functioning lever: enables housing (-25.2 pp overcrowding), healthcare (-19.8 pp skipping) BUT also drinking (+27.8 pp) and violence exposure (+22.5 pp) |
| **Vicious Cycle** | **20%** | Discrimination ↔ Smoking ↔ Violence: bidirectional feedback loop (8.1pp, 13.2pp, 11.9pp) |
| **Housing** | **10%** | Income enables escape from overcrowding (25.2 pp reduction) |
| **Healthcare Access** | **5%** | Even with income, 42.7% skip care due to discrimination in medical settings |
| **Social Isolation** | **5%** | Weakest support networks + highest violence = compound vulnerability |
| **Education** | **0%** | COMPLETELY BROKEN: Zero returns on income (0.99×), health (p=0.498), behaviors (p=0.857) |

**Summary**: For Bangkok's LGBT+ community, structural discrimination (39.1%, 97% gender-based) has eliminated all typical SDHE pathways. Education provides zero returns on income, health, or behaviors. Income is the only functioning protective factor but is double-edged: it reduces overcrowding by 25.2 pp and healthcare skipping by 19.8 pp, but simultaneously increases drinking by 27.8 pp and violence exposure by 22.5 pp. The community is trapped in vicious cycles where discrimination, smoking, and violence reinforce each other (bidirectional effects: 8.1pp, 13.2pp, 11.9pp), compounded by the weakest support networks of any group.

## 4. Disabled Population - "The Amplification Story"

**Population**: 229 disabled individuals (4% of survey)
**Key Characteristic**: Education and income effects are AMPLIFIED beyond all other groups

### The Health Inequality Pattern

For Bangkok's disabled population, **education and income matter more than for any other group**. Education creates a 2.84× income multiplier—the highest of all populations. Income directly reduces disease (r=-0.299)—the strongest income-health correlation in the study. This creates the most extreme health stratification: 87.3% chronic disease among low-educated disabled vs 49.6% among educated disabled. But this amplification works both ways—61% of low-income disabled cannot access needed healthcare, the worst access crisis of any group.

---

### Pathway 1: Education—The Most Powerful Amplifier (32% of health influence)

**The strongest education effects in the entire study**:

### **Education → Chronic Disease (STRONGEST)**

- Primary educated disabled: **87.3% chronic disease**
- Bachelor+ educated disabled: **49.6% chronic disease**
- **Gap: -37.7 pp** (r=-0.305, p<0.001)

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Gap |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 87.3% | — |
| Bachelor+ | 49.6% | -37.7 pp |
| **Effect** | **LARGEST gap in study** | r=-0.305, p<0.001 |

**This is the LARGEST education-health gap of any population group.**

Low-educated disabled are **76% more likely to be chronically ill** than educated disabled.

---

### **Education → Income (HIGHEST RETURNS)**

- Bachelor+ disabled: **24,981 baht/month**
- Primary educated disabled: **8,787 baht/month**
- **Gap: +16,194 baht** (184% premium)
- **Income multiplier: 2.84×—HIGHEST of any group**

| Education Level | Monthly Income | Gap |
|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Primary or less | 8,787 baht | — |
| Bachelor+ | 24,981 baht | +16,194 baht |
| **Multiplier** | **2.84× (HIGHEST)** | 184% premium |

**For comparison**:
- Disabled: **2.84×**
- Informal workers: 1.84×
- General population: 1.5×
- Elderly: 1.43×
- LGBT+: 0.99× (broken)

| Population Group | Education Income Multiplier |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Disabled** | **2.84× (HIGHEST)** |
| Informal workers | 1.84× |
| General population | 1.5× |
| Elderly | 1.43× |
| LGBT+ | 0.99× (BROKEN) |

**Why education provides enormous benefits for disabled**:
- Knowledge work doesn't require physical mobility
- Remote work opportunities (pandemic accelerated accessibility)
- Professional licensing (CPA, law, medicine) protects from discrimination
- Employers value technical skills over physical appearance for certain roles
- Adaptive technology enables high-productivity work

---

### **Education → Exercise (STRONGEST GRADIENT)**

- Bachelor+ disabled: **36.4% exercise regularly**
- Primary educated disabled: **13.2% exercise**
- **Gap: +23.1 pp** (p=0.005)—**STRONGEST education-exercise gradient of any group**

**Why**:
- Health literacy enables understanding of adaptive exercise options
- Economic resources enable accessible gyms, equipment purchases
- Social networks connect to disability sports communities
- Self-efficacy: educated disabled believe exercise is possible

---

### **Education → Functional Skills**

- Math skills: **94.8%** (high edu) vs **73.4%** (low edu) = **+21.4 pp** (p<0.0001)
- Writing skills: **95.3%** (high edu) vs **73.9%** (low edu) = **+21.4 pp** (p<0.0001)

**Why functional skills matter uniquely for disabled**:
- Math: budgeting for expensive assistive devices, medical costs
- Writing: advocating for accessibility accommodations, navigating bureaucracy
- Literacy: understanding complex medical/insurance systems
- Numeracy: managing medication schedules, health monitoring

**Education provides literal functional capacity that enables independence.**

*Education: 32% of total health impact (MOST POWERFUL FACTOR)*

---

### Pathway 2: Income Directly Reduces Disease (28% of health influence)

**The ONLY group where income has a direct disease effect**:

### **Income → Chronic Disease (STRONGEST CORRELATION)**

- Disabled WITH chronic disease: **15,699 baht/month**
- Disabled WITHOUT chronic disease: **24,350 baht/month**
- **Gap: -8,651 baht** (r=-0.299, p<0.001)

| Health Status | Monthly Income | Gap |
|--------------|----------------|-----|
| WITH chronic disease | 15,699 baht | — |
| WITHOUT chronic disease | 24,350 baht | +8,651 baht |
| **Effect** | **STRONGEST in study** | r=-0.299, p<0.001 |

**This is the STRONGEST income-health correlation in the entire study.**

**Why income directly affects disease for disabled (unlike other groups)**:

Monthly accessibility costs that low-income disabled cannot afford:
- Wheelchair maintenance/replacement: 500-2,000 baht/month
- Accessible transportation: 1,500 baht/month
- Assistive devices (screen readers, special keyboards, hearing aids): 300-1,000 baht/month
- Physical therapy: 1,200 baht/month
- Medications: 2,000 baht/month
- Accessible housing modifications: 5,000+ baht upfront

**Total accessibility cost: ~5,500 baht/month**

**Low-income disabled (8,787 baht income)**: After rent and food, cannot afford accessibility → disability worsens → secondary conditions develop → disease compounds

**High-income disabled (24,981 baht income)**: Can afford modifications, devices, therapy → disability managed → secondary conditions prevented → disease controlled

**Income enables disease management mechanisms that don't exist for other populations.**

*Income: 28% of total health impact (DIRECT DISEASE EFFECT)*

---

### Pathway 3: Healthcare Access Crisis—Worst of All Groups (20% of health influence)

**The catastrophic access gap**:

**Low-income disabled**:
- **61.1% skip needed medical care** (MAJORITY!)

**Higher-income disabled**:
- **23.4% skip care**

**Gap: -37.7 pp** (2.6× higher skipping rate, p<0.001)

| Income Level | Skip Needed Medical Care | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----|
| Low income | 61.1% | — |
| Higher income | 23.4% | -37.7 pp |
| **Effect** | **WORST of all groups** | 2.6× higher, p<0.001 |

**Why disabled face worst healthcare barriers**:

**Transportation**:
- Accessible vehicles cost 300-500 baht per trip
- Public transit lacks accessibility (no elevators, ramps)
- Most low-income disabled cannot afford accessible transportation

**Facility accessibility**:
- Many clinics lack wheelchair ramps, elevators
- Bathrooms not accessible
- Waiting areas uncomfortable for extended waits
- Examination tables not height-adjustable

**Provider barriers**:
- Longer appointment times needed (providers refuse, "too complicated")
- Doctors unfamiliar with disability-specific conditions
- Disability stigma in medical settings
- Communication barriers (sign language, cognitive disabilities)

**Economic barriers**:
- Specialized care more expensive
- Limited availability of disability specialists
- Cannot afford prescribed assistive devices
- Medication costs higher (multiple conditions)

**The result**: Low-income disabled face government clinics with 2-hour waits, no ramps (must crawl up stairs), 5-minute doctor visits, unaffordable medications → **they stop going**

High-income disabled can afford private hospitals with online booking, accessible parking, elevators, disability-knowledgeable doctors, affordable medications → **disease is managed**

**Same disability. Different income. Completely different health outcomes.**

*Healthcare access: 20% of total health impact (CRITICAL CRISIS)*

---

### Pathway 4: Environmental Trap—Homeownership in Disaster Zones (10% of health influence)

**The immobility paradox**:

- Disabled homeowners: **+19.6 pp MORE disaster exposure** than renters (p=0.002)

**Why homeownership creates environmental vulnerability for disabled**:

**Affordability constraint**:
- Can only afford homes in disaster-prone areas
- Need ground-floor accessibility (no elevators in affordable rentals)
- Banks discriminate in lending (can't get loans for better locations)

**Evacuation impossibility**:
- Limited mobility prevents evacuation during floods
- Cannot move belongings/assistive devices quickly
- Depend on others for emergency transport (often unavailable)

**Disaster impact on disability**:
- Floods destroy wheelchairs (8,000 baht replacement—months without mobility)
- Assistive devices damaged (5,000+ baht replacement)
- Access to medications cut off during disasters
- Health deteriorates from stress, lack of care access

**Relocation impossibility**:
- Even recognizing the risk, cannot relocate due to:
  - Limited income prevents purchase elsewhere
  - Housing discrimination against disabled
  - Need for accessibility features limits options
  - Literally immobile (cannot move belongings)

**For disabled, homeownership = environmental trap**

*Environment: 10% of total health impact*

---

### Pathway 5: The Income Paradox—Harmful Coping Behaviors (5% of health influence)

**When resources enable unhealthy stress-coping**:

**High-income disabled show concerning patterns**:

**Smoking**:
- High-income disabled: **27.2% smoke**
- Low-income disabled: **0% smoke**
- **Gap: +27.2 pp** (p=0.089, marginal due to small n=113)

**Drinking**:
- High-income disabled: **46.9% drink**
- Low-income disabled: **25.0% drink**
- **Gap: +21.9 pp** (p=0.265)

**Triple-risk behaviors** (smoking + drinking + no exercise):
- High-income disabled: **9.9%**
- Low-income disabled: **0%**

**Why this pattern exists**:
- Resources enable substance use as stress-coping mechanism
- Social isolation (even with income) drives drinking behavior
- Medical constraints and disability create chronic psychological stress
- Substance use becomes accessible outlet for stress
- Social drinking culture in disability communities

**Poverty as "protective"**: Low-income disabled literally cannot afford these harmful behaviors—economic constraint prevents unhealthy consumption.

*This is a small but real pattern unique to disabled population.*

*Harmful coping: 5% of total health impact*

---

### The Complete Picture: Disabled Health Destiny

| Factor | Influence | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Education** | **32%** | MOST POWERFUL: 2.84× income (highest), -37.7pp disease gap (largest), +23.1pp exercise (strongest gradient), functional skills enable independence |
| **Income** | **28%** | DIRECT disease effect (r=-0.299, strongest): -8,651 baht gap enables accessibility modifications, assistive devices, therapy, disease management |
| **Healthcare Access Crisis** | **20%** | 61.1% low-income skip care (WORST of all groups): transportation, facility accessibility, provider, economic barriers compound |
| **Environmental Disasters** | **10%** | Homeownership paradox: affordable homes in flood zones, cannot evacuate, assistive devices destroyed, trapped by immobility |
| **Functional Skills** | **5%** | Literacy +21.4pp, numeracy +21.4pp (embedded in education): enables self-advocacy, budget management, medical navigation |
| **Income→Harmful Coping** | **5%** | High-income enables smoking (27.2% vs 0%), drinking (46.9% vs 25%): resources fund stress-coping, poverty "protective" |

**Summary**: For Bangkok's disabled population, education creates the strongest amplification effects: 2.84× income multiplier (highest of all groups) and 37.7 pp chronic disease reduction (largest gap). Income has a unique direct effect on disease (r=-0.299) by enabling accessibility modifications, assistive devices, and therapy costing ~5,500 baht/month. However, this amplification creates extreme stratification: low-income disabled face 87.3% disease burden + 61.1% healthcare access crisis (worst of any group), while environmental traps keep homeowners in disaster-prone areas they cannot evacuate. The paradox: resources also enable harmful coping (27.2% smoking among high-income vs 0% among low-income).

## 5. Comparative Analysis

### What Matters Most: Cross-Group Comparison

| Factor | Informal Workers | Elderly | LGBT+ | Disabled |
|--------|------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **#1 Factor** | Education (30%) | Air Pollution (25%) | Discrimination (35%) | Education (32%) |
| **#2 Factor** | Income (20%) | Employment Contracts (20%) | Income (25%) | Income (28%) |
| **#3 Factor** | Environment (15%) | Income/Healthcare (18%) | Vicious Cycle (20%) | Healthcare Crisis (20%) |
| **Unique Finding** | Exercise works ONLY here | Lifetime contracts > education | Education returns = ZERO | Strongest amplification (2.84×) |

---

### Universal Patterns Across Groups

**Pattern 1: Education Usually Protects (Except When Broken by Discrimination)**

- **Informal workers**: Education → 1.84× income → healthcare access → disease prevention ✅
- **Elderly**: Education → lifetime contracts → retirement security → symptom management ✅
- **Disabled**: Education → 2.84× income → accessibility → disease management ✅ (STRONGEST)
- **LGBT+**: Education → 0.99× income (ZERO effect on all outcomes) ❌ (BROKEN)

**Insight**: Discrimination doesn't just reduce education's benefits—it **eliminates them entirely**.

---

**Pattern 2: Income Effects Vary Wildly by Population**

- **Informal workers**: Income enables healthcare, reduces disease **indirectly** (r=-0.091)
- **Elderly**: Income manages symptoms, **doesn't prevent** disease (age dominates)
- **LGBT+**: Income is **double-edged** (safety vs harmful coping/violence)
- **Disabled**: Income **directly reduces** disease (r=-0.299, accessibility/devices)

**Insight**: Income's health impact depends on **how** it works—indirectly through healthcare, directly through accessibility, or paradoxically through harmful visibility.

---

**Pattern 3: Environmental Threats Differ by Vulnerability**

- **Informal workers**: Multi-hazard disaster zones (85.7% exposed—flood, heat, pollution)
- **Elderly**: Air pollution (r=0.440, 43.6 pp symptom gap—**strongest environmental effect**)
- **LGBT+**: Violence as environmental exposure (39.4% rate, +15.5 pp)
- **Disabled**: Disaster zones + immobility trap (homeowners +19.6 pp exposure, cannot evacuate)

**Insight**: Environment threatens everyone, but **different mechanisms** for each group—poverty-driven exposure, cumulative pollution damage, social hostility, or immobility traps.

---

**Pattern 4: Social Factors Diverge Dramatically**

**Strong Protection**:
- **Informal workers**: -13.7 pp violence, +5.8 pp support (community solidarity)
- **Elderly**: -20.1 pp violence, +11.0 pp support (cultural respect, family ties)

**Vulnerability**:
- **LGBT+**: +15.5 pp violence, -1.5 pp support (discrimination + isolation)

**Mixed**:
- **Disabled**: Depends on income/education (no consistent pattern)

**Insight**: Social protection isn't universal—it's strongest for culturally respected groups and weakest for stigmatized groups.

---

### Most Urgent Policy Implications

**Crisis-Level Findings**:

1. **61% Low-Income Disabled Skip Medical Care** (healthcare access emergency)
   - Worst access of any group
   - Compounds disability through untreated conditions
   - Transportation, facility, provider, economic barriers

2. **LGBT+ Zero Education Returns** (discrimination breaks all pathways)

3. **64.9% Elderly Air Pollution Symptoms** (environmental health emergency)
   - r=0.440 correlation (extremely strong)
   - Major modifiable risk
   - Requires air quality intervention

4. **49.4% Low-Income Informal Workers Skip Care** (economic barrier)
   - Nearly half cannot access needed healthcare
   - Preventable disease progression
   - Requires affordable healthcare + income support

5. **LGBT+ Vicious Cycles** (self-reinforcing harm)
   - Discrimination → Smoking → Violence → Discrimination
   - Bidirectional feedback loops trap community
   - Requires breaking cycle at multiple points

### Accessibility Standards

**All diagrams must include**:
- Color-blind safe palettes (use patterns + textures, not just colors)
- High contrast text (minimum 4.5:1 ratio, WCAG AA)
- Screen reader alt text for each slice
- Descriptive legends explaining statistical notation
- Multiple sensory channels (color + pattern + icon + size)

**Statistical Notation Legend**:
- **r** = Correlation coefficient (-1 to +1; negative = protective, positive = harmful)
- **pp** = Percentage points (absolute difference between groups)
- **p-value**: p<0.001 (⭐⭐⭐ highly significant), p<0.01 (⭐⭐ very significant), p<0.05 (⭐ significant)
- **×** = Multiplier (e.g., 2.84× = 184% higher income for Bachelor+ vs primary education)
- **Gap** = Absolute difference between groups

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Strongest Effects by Type

**Education Effects**:
1. Disabled: 2.84× income, -37.7pp disease (AMPLIFIED)
2. Informal: 1.84× income, -23.0pp disease (STRONG)
3. Elderly: 1.43× income, -14.1pp disease (MODERATE)
4. LGBT+: 0.99× income, -8.4pp disease NS (BROKEN)

**Income Effects**:
1. Disabled: r=-0.299 disease (DIRECT)
2. LGBT+: -25.2pp housing, +27.8pp drinking (DOUBLE-EDGED)
3. Informal: -11.5pp disease, 30.7pp healthcare (INDIRECT)
4. Elderly: 30.9pp healthcare (MANAGEMENT, NOT PREVENTION)

**Environmental Effects**:
1. Elderly air pollution: r=0.440, 43.6pp (STRONGEST IN STUDY)
2. Informal disasters: 18.3pp exposure gap (MULTI-HAZARD)
3. LGBT+ violence: +15.5pp exposure (SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT)
4. Disabled disasters: +19.6pp with immobility (TRAP)

**Social Effects**:
1. Elderly protection: -20.1pp violence, +11.0pp support (STRONGEST)
2. Informal protection: -13.7pp violence, +5.8pp support (STRONG)
3. LGBT+ isolation: +15.5pp violence, -1.5pp support (VULNERABLE)

### Policy Priority Matrix

**Immediate Action Required** (Crisis-Level):
- 61% disabled skip healthcare (access emergency)
- 64.9% elderly air pollution symptoms (environmental emergency)
- LGBT+ zero education returns (discrimination crisis)

**High Priority** (Major Impact Potential):
- 49.4% informal workers skip care (economic barrier)
- LGBT+ vicious cycles (self-reinforcing harm)
- Disabled environmental traps (immobility + disasters)

**Medium Priority** (Important but Complex):
- Informal worker disaster exposure (85.7% in multi-hazard zones)
- Elderly income-healthcare gap (3.4× skipping rate)
- Income → harmful coping patterns (LGBT+ drinking, disabled substances)
