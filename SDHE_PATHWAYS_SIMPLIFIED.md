## 1. Informal Workers - The Education Cascade

### Pattern

## 2. Elderly Population (60+) - Lifetime Consequences

### Pattern
38.4% still work at age 72.4 (employed have 12.5pp less disease, p<0.000001). 73.7% of employed are informal workers earning 14,388 baht/month - formal workers earn 1.32× more (p=0.000059). Air pollution shows strongest environmental correlation (r=0.440). Income does NOT correlate with disease at age 68 (p=0.095). Multi-elderly households (48.7%) explain reverse overcrowding pattern.

### Pathways

**Pathway 1: Current Occupation Status → Income & Health**

**Employment Status (38.4% still working at age 72.4)**:

| Status | Chronic Disease | Sample |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Employed | 71.1% | n=1,147 (38.4%) |
| Unemployed | 83.5% | n=1,839 (61.6%) |
| **Gap** | **-12.5pp** | — |
| **p-value** | **p<0.000001 ✅✅✅** | — |

**Among Employed - Occupation Types** (monthly income):

| Occupation Type | % of Employed | Monthly Income |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Government | 0.6% | 24,400 baht |
| State enterprise | 0.3% | 21,500 baht |
| Company employee | 8.5% | 18,435 baht |
| Own business | 8.5% | 16,482 baht |
| **Informal/freelance** | **73.7%** | **14,388 baht** |
| Other | 8.3% | 11,974 baht |

**Formal vs Informal Workers**:

| Type | Monthly Income | Sample |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Formal (gov + company) | 18,948 baht | n=76 |
| Informal workers | 14,388 baht | n=626 |
| **Gap** | **+4,560 baht (1.32×)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.000059 ✅** | — |

**Explanation**: 38.4% of elderly still work at age 72.4. Employed elderly have 12.5pp LESS chronic disease (p<0.000001). 73.7% work in informal sector earning 14,388 baht/month. Formal workers earn 1.32× more (18,948 baht, p=0.000059) - a modest but statistically significant gap. Temporal direction unclear (health enables work vs work improves health). Mechanisms unknown.

**Pathway 2: Education → Assets**

| Education | Homeownership | Exercise |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Primary | 41.1% | 16.7% |
| Bachelor+ | 76.2% | 38.8% |
| **Gap** | **+35.1pp** | **+22.1pp** |
| **p-value** | p<0.001 | p<0.001 |

**Explanation**: Higher education correlates with more homeownership and exercise. Mechanisms unknown.

---

**Pathway 3: Income → Healthcare Access (NOT Disease)**

| Income | Skip Care | Chronic Disease |

| High income | 12.7% | 86.5% |
| **Gap** | **-30.9pp (3.4× rate)** | -3.1pp |
| **p-value** | p<0.001 | **p=0.095 (NOT significant)** |

**Explanation**: Income correlates with healthcare access (30.9pp less skipping) but does NOT correlate with disease (p=0.095). Age 68 dominates disease burden (88% overall). Mechanisms unknown.

---

**Pathway 4: Air Pollution (STRONGEST environmental effect)**

| Exposure | Respiratory Symptoms |
|----------|---------------------|
| Not exposed | 21.3% |
| Exposed | 64.9% |
| **Gap** | **+43.6pp** |
| **Correlation** | **r=0.440** |
| **p-value** | p<0.001 |

**Explanation**: Strongest environmental correlation in entire study (r=0.440). Air pollution exposure correlates with 43.6pp more respiratory symptoms. Mechanisms for exposure not measured.

---

**Pathway 5: Housing (REVERSE pattern)**

| Income | Overcrowding |
|--------|-------------|
| Low income | 37.6% |
| High income | 48.1% |
| **Gap** | **+10.4pp (REVERSE)** |
| **p-value** | p=0.006 |

**Explanation**: High-income elderly MORE overcrowded than low-income (reverse of other groups). Reasons unknown (hospital proximity hypothesis not tested).

---

**Pathway 6: Social Protection (STRONGEST of all groups)**

| Measure | Elderly | General Population | Gap |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Violence | 3.8% | 24.0% | **-20.1pp (84% lower)** |
| Social Support | 95.1% | 84.1% | **+11.0pp (HIGHEST)** |
| Discrimination | 8.5% | 17.6% | **-9.1pp (48% lower)** |
| **p-values** | p<0.001 | — | All significant |

**Explanation**: Elderly have strongest social protection of all groups. Mechanisms unknown (cultural respect not measured).

---

**Pathway 7: Multi-Elderly Households (NEW - Family Structure)**

**Pattern**: 48.7% of elderly live with other elderly (2+ elderly in household). These multi-elderly households correlate with MORE homeownership, MORE overcrowding, and MORE chronic disease.

| Family Structure | Homeownership | Overcrowding | Chronic Disease | Sample |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Lives with other elderly (2+) | 52.0% | 92.9% | 80.4% | n=1,455 |
| Does NOT live with other elderly | 45.2% | 90.9% | 77.1% | n=1,531 |
| **Gap** | **+6.8pp** | **+2.0pp** | **+3.3pp** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.0002 ✅** | **p=0.0453 ✅** | **p=0.0289 ✅** | — |

**Living Arrangements**:
- 48.7% live with other elderly (2+ elderly in household)
- 67.3% live in multi-generational households (elderly + working-age)
- 11.8% live in elderly-only households (no working-age members)
- 1.9% live alone

**Reverse Overcrowding Pattern EXPLAINED**:

| Family Structure | Low-Income Overcrowding | High-Income Overcrowding | Gap | p-value |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----|---------|
| Lives with other elderly | 92.3% | **96.7%** | **+4.5pp** | **p=0.0179 ✅** |
| Lives with working-age | 92.7% | **96.4%** | **+3.7pp** | **p=0.0143 ✅** |

**Explanation**: Multi-elderly households correlate with more homeownership (+6.8pp, p=0.0002), suggesting family homes. These households also show MORE overcrowding (+2.0pp) and MORE disease (+3.3pp). The REVERSE overcrowding pattern (high-income MORE overcrowded) exists in BOTH family structures (p<0.02), possibly because high-income elderly prioritize healthcare proximity over space. Family structure does NOT significantly predict income (p=0.1993). Mechanisms unknown (hospital proximity, location choice, caregiving arrangements not measured).

## 3. LGBT+ Community - Broken Pathways

### Pattern
Discrimination highest (39.1%). Education shows NO correlation with income (0.99×, p=0.993) or health (p=0.498). Income is only functioning factor but double-edged (protective + harmful).

**Explanation**: LGBT+ experience 2.2× more discrimination, 97% gender-based. Mechanisms and impacts not directly tested.

## Key Statistical Notes

1. **All pathways show correlations, NOT causation** - mechanisms unknown unless directly tested
2. **"Mechanisms unknown"** = correlation observed but reasons not established by data
3. **p<0.05** = statistically significant correlation
4. **NOT significant** = pattern observed but could be random chance
5. **Variables NOT measured** = cannot determine if they explain correlations
