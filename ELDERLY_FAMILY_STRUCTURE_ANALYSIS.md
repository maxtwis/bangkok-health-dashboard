# Elderly Family Structure Analysis
## Living Arrangements, Income, Housing & Health Correlations

**Bangkok Health Equity Survey - Elderly Population (Age 60+)**
**Sample**: n=2,986 elderly respondents
**Average Age**: 72.4 years
**Date**: 2025-11-17

---

## Key Finding

**Elderly living with other elderly (2+ elderly in household) correlates with:**
- ✅ **MORE homeownership** (+6.8pp, p=0.0002) - SIGNIFICANT
- ⚠️ **MORE overcrowding** (+2.0pp, p=0.0453) - SIGNIFICANT
- ⚠️ **MORE chronic disease** (+3.3pp, p=0.0289) - SIGNIFICANT

**This explains the REVERSE overcrowding pattern**: High-income elderly MORE overcrowded because they live with other elderly family members (multi-elderly households), and these households have MORE homeownership.

| **Children <5 years** | 0.12 | 0 |
| **Working-age (15-59)** | 2.19 | 2.0 |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 3.90 | 2.0 |

### Living Arrangement Patterns

| Living Arrangement | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| **Lives with other elderly (2+ elderly in household)** | 1,455 | **48.7%** |

## 2. Family Structure × Income Correlations

### Lives with Other Elderly (2+ elderly in household)

| Family Structure | Income | Sample |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Lives with other elderly (2+) | 4,004 baht | n=372 |
| Does NOT live with other elderly | 4,748 baht | n=491 |
| **Gap** | **-744 baht (-15.7%)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.1993 (NOT significant)** | — |

**Observation**: Multi-elderly households have 15.7% lower income, but NOT statistically significant (p=0.1993).

---

### Lives with Working-Age Members

| Family Structure | Income | Sample |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Lives with working-age | 4,767 baht | n=570 |
| Does NOT live with working-age | 3,767 baht | n=293 |
| **Gap** | **+1,000 baht (+26.5%)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.0992 (NOT significant)** | — |

**Observation**: Living with working-age members correlates with 26.5% higher income, but marginally not significant (p=0.0992).

---

### Lives Alone

| Family Structure | Income | Sample |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Lives alone | 4,740 baht | n=20 |
| Does NOT live alone | 4,420 baht | n=843 |
| **Gap** | **+319 baht (+7.2%)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.8671 (NOT significant)** | — |

**Observation**: Living alone shows no significant income difference (p=0.8671). Very small sample (n=20).

---

### Elderly-Only Households (no working-age members)

| Family Structure | Income | Sample |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Elderly-only household | 4,999 baht | n=93 |
| Multi-generational | 4,358 baht | n=770 |
| **Gap** | **+641 baht (+14.7%)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.4891 (NOT significant)** | — |

**Observation**: Elderly-only households have 14.7% higher income, but NOT significant (p=0.4891).

**Statistical note**: NONE of the income correlations reach statistical significance. Family structure does NOT significantly predict income among elderly.

## 3. Family Structure × Housing Correlations

### Lives with Other Elderly (2+ elderly in household)

| Outcome | With Other Elderly | Without | Gap | p-value |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-----|---------|
| **Homeownership** | **52.0%** | 45.2% | **+6.8pp** | **p=0.0002 ✅** |
| **Overcrowding** | **92.9%** | 90.9% | **+2.0pp** | **p=0.0453 ✅** |
| **Chronic Disease** | **80.4%** | 77.1% | **+3.3pp** | **p=0.0289 ✅** |
| **Sample** | n=1,455 | n=1,531 | — | — |

**✅ SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS**:
1. **Multi-elderly households have 6.8pp MORE homeownership** (p=0.0002, highly significant)
2. **Multi-elderly households have 2.0pp MORE overcrowding** (p=0.0453, significant)
3. **Multi-elderly households have 3.3pp MORE chronic disease** (p=0.0289, significant)

**Interpretation**: Living with other elderly correlates with owning a home (likely family home), but this home is MORE overcrowded and residents have more disease.

---

### Lives with Working-Age Members

| Outcome | With Working-Age | Without | Gap | p-value |
|---------|-----------------|---------|-----|---------|
| **Homeownership** | 48.6% | 48.3% | +0.4pp | p=0.8541 (NS) |
| **Overcrowding** | **93.2%** | 88.9% | **+4.3pp** | **p=0.0001 ✅** |
| **Chronic Disease** | **80.6%** | 74.6% | **+6.0pp** | **p=0.0002 ✅** |
| **Sample** | n=2,058 | n=928 | — | — |

**✅ SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS**:
1. **Living with working-age correlates with 4.3pp MORE overcrowding** (p=0.0001)
2. **Living with working-age correlates with 6.0pp MORE chronic disease** (p=0.0002)

**Interpretation**: Multi-generational households are MORE overcrowded (more people = more crowded) and elderly in these households have more disease.

---

### Lives Alone

| Outcome | Lives Alone | Lives with Others | Gap | p-value |
|---------|------------|------------------|-----|---------|
| **Homeownership** | 50.9% | 48.5% | +2.4pp | p=0.7200 (NS) |
| **Overcrowding** | 87.7% | 92.0% | -4.3pp | p=0.2435 (NS) |
| **Chronic Disease** | 70.2% | 78.9% | -8.7pp | p=0.1109 (NS) |
| **Sample** | n=57 | n=2,929 | — | — |

**Observation**: Living alone shows 8.7pp LESS disease, but NOT significant (p=0.1109). Very small sample (n=57, only 1.9% of elderly).

---

## 4. THE REVERSE OVERCROWDING PATTERN EXPLAINED

### Overall Income × Overcrowding (REVERSE Pattern)

| Income | Overcrowding Rate |
|--------|------------------|
| Low-income elderly | 91.2% |
| High-income elderly | 95.6% |
| **Gap** | **+4.4pp (REVERSE)** |

**This is OPPOSITE to all other groups** (normally high-income = less overcrowding).

---

### Breakdown by Family Structure: High-Income Elderly MORE Overcrowded

| Family Structure | Low-Income Overcrowding | High-Income Overcrowding | Gap | p-value |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----|---------|
| **Lives with other elderly** | 92.3% | **96.7%** | **+4.5pp** | **p=0.0179 ✅** |
| **Lives with working-age** | 92.7% | **96.4%** | **+3.7pp** | **p=0.0143 ✅** |
| **Lives alone** | 87.0% | 90.9% | +4.0pp | p=0.7255 (NS) |

**✅ EXPLANATION FOUND**:

The reverse overcrowding pattern (high-income elderly MORE overcrowded) exists in BOTH family structures:

1. **Among elderly living with other elderly**: High-income 96.7% vs Low-income 92.3% (p=0.0179)
2. **Among elderly living with working-age**: High-income 96.4% vs Low-income 92.7% (p=0.0143)

**Possible Mechanism** (hypothesis, NOT tested):
- High-income elderly may choose to live in **smaller apartments near hospitals** (prioritizing healthcare proximity over space)
- Multi-elderly households (common at 48.7%) share a home, creating overcrowding
- Multi-generational households (67.3%) have more people → more overcrowding
- Higher income allows choosing location (near hospitals) rather than size

| Correlation | Gap | p-value | Interpretation |
|------------|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Multi-elderly household → Homeownership** | **+6.8pp** | **p=0.0002** | Multi-elderly households own homes more |

| **High-income (with workers) → Overcrowding** | **+3.7pp** | **p=0.0143** | REVERSE: high-income more overcrowded |

---

### ❌ NOT Significant (p>0.05)

| Correlation | Gap | p-value | Interpretation |
|------------|-----|---------|----------------|
| Multi-elderly household → Income | -744 baht (-15.7%) | p=0.1993 | No significant income difference |
| Living with working-age → Income | +1,000 baht (+26.5%) | p=0.0992 | Marginal (close to significant) |
| Living alone → Income | +319 baht (+7.2%) | p=0.8671 | No difference |
| Elderly-only household → Income | +641 baht (+14.7%) | p=0.4891 | No difference |
| Living alone → All outcomes | Various | p>0.05 | Small sample (n=57) limits power |

## 6. Key Insights

### 1. **Multi-Elderly Households Are Common (48.7%)**

Nearly half of elderly live with other elderly family members. This is a distinct family structure pattern.

---

### 2. **Multi-Elderly Households → Homeownership (p=0.0002)**

Living with other elderly correlates strongly with homeownership (+6.8pp). Possible reasons (NOT tested):
- Family home passed down or shared
- Pooled resources to buy/maintain home
- Cultural preference for family living

---

### 3. **The Reverse Overcrowding Pattern Explained**

High-income elderly are MORE overcrowded (+4.4pp) because:
1. They live in multi-elderly households (48.7%) which are more crowded
2. They live in multi-generational households (67.3%) with more people
3. Both patterns show SIGNIFICANT reverse overcrowding (p<0.02)

**Hypothesis** (NOT tested): High-income elderly may prioritize **healthcare proximity** over space, choosing smaller apartments near hospitals. This would explain why high-income → more overcrowding (unique to elderly).

---

### 4. **Multi-Elderly Households → More Disease (p=0.0289)**

Living with other elderly correlates with 3.3pp more chronic disease. Possible reasons (NOT tested):
- Sicker elderly move in with family for care
- Shared risk factors in family (genetics, environment)
- Selection bias (healthier elderly live alone/independently)

---

### 5. **Family Structure Does NOT Predict Income**

NONE of the family structure variables significantly predict income:
- Multi-elderly: p=0.1993
- With working-age: p=0.0992 (marginal)
- Lives alone: p=0.8671
- Elderly-only: p=0.4891

**This is different from the employment contract pathway** (past contracts → +46% income, p<0.0001), which DOES predict income.

---

## 7. What This Does NOT Show

Variables NOT measured:
- **Proximity to hospitals** (hypothesis for reverse overcrowding NOT tested)
- **Reasons for living arrangement** (choice vs necessity)
- **Caregiver relationships** (who cares for whom)
- **Financial contributions** (who pays for housing)
- **Decision-making** (who chose the location/home)
- **Health status before vs after moving** (temporal direction unclear)
- **Quality of housing** (size in sq meters, # rooms not measured)
- **Geographic location** (distance to hospitals, clinics)

**New Pathway for Elderly**: Family Structure → Housing Pattern

### Pathway 7 (NEW): Multi-Elderly Households

| Family Structure | Homeownership | Overcrowding | Chronic Disease |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Lives with other elderly (2+) | 52.0% | 92.9% | 80.4% |
| Does NOT live with other elderly | 45.2% | 90.9% | 77.1% |
| **Gap** | **+6.8pp** | **+2.0pp** | **+3.3pp** |
| **p-value** | **p=0.0002 ✅** | **p=0.0453 ✅** | **p=0.0289 ✅** |

**Explanation**: 48.7% of elderly live with other elderly (2+ elderly in household). These multi-elderly households correlate with more homeownership (+6.8pp, p=0.0002), more overcrowding (+2.0pp, p=0.0453), and more chronic disease (+3.3pp, p=0.0289). This pattern helps explain why high-income elderly are MORE overcrowded than low-income elderly—both groups live in multi-elderly/multi-generational households, but high-income may prioritize healthcare proximity over space. Mechanisms unknown (location choice, hospital proximity not measured).
