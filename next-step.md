- Clustering adjustment: Applied for geographic community clustering
- Coverage adjustment: Applied based on volunteer network reach

Targeted Outreach Component (33% of sample):
- Weight: w_outreach = 1.0 (equal weight for systematic outreach collection)
- Population matching: Weighted to represent target demographics
- Venue diversity: Adjusted for multiple collection settings
```

#### Integrated Dataset Calibration
```
Step 1 - Collection Method Integration:
w_integrated = (w_volunteer × n_volunteer + w_outreach × n_outreach) / n_total

Step 2 - Demographic Post-Stratification:
w_demo = w_integrated × (Bangkok_population_ag / Sample_population_ag)

Step 3 - District Population Adjustment:
w_district = w_demo × (District_pop / Bangkok_pop) × (Bangkok_sample / District_sample)

Final Weight:
w_final = w_district × calibration_factor
```
