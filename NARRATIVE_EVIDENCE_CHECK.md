# Evidence-Based Narrative Verification

## Claims We CAN Support with Survey Data

### Employment & Income
✓ **Contract gaps exist** - 0% informal workers vs 95.9% general population
✓ **Income disparities confirmed** - Elderly earn 15,773 THB less
✓ **Welfare exclusion verified** - 8.8% elderly vs 81.9% general have welfare
✓ **Employment rates measured** - 39.9% disabled vs 92.6% general employed

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ Discrimination is "the cause" (correlation ≠ causation)
- ✗ "Shadow economy" specifics (no data on informal economy structure)
- ✗ Employer biases (need employer surveys)

### Education & Skills
✓ **Education gaps confirmed** - 61% elderly with primary only vs 5.4% general
✓ **Literacy differences measured** - 80.6% disabled can do math vs 99.6% general
✓ **Training access gaps** - 9.7% disabled vs 28.7% general have training

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ Historical context of Thai education expansion (need historical data)
- ✗ School infrastructure barriers (need school facility audits)
- ✗ "Systematic exclusion" mechanisms (need education policy analysis)

### Healthcare Access
✓ **Coverage gaps confirmed** - 37.6% disabled vs 76.4% general have welfare
✓ **Cost barriers measured** - 28.8% LGBT+ vs 16% general skip care (no money)
✓ **Fear barriers measured** - 23.2% LGBT+ vs 13.8% general skip care (fear)
✓ **Correlation exists** - LGBT+ have both higher discrimination AND higher fear-based skipping

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "Bureaucratic barriers" specifics (need administrative data)
- ✗ Healthcare provider discrimination (need provider/patient interaction data)
- ✗ Whether fear is due to past discrimination vs anticipated (need longitudinal data)

### Chronic Diseases
✓ **Disease burden confirmed** - 76.5% elderly vs 10.2% general have hypertension
✓ **Multiple conditions cluster** - Can calculate comorbidity rates
✓ **Employment-disease correlation** - Informal workers have higher disease rates

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "Decades of limited healthcare access" as cause (need longitudinal data)
- ✗ "Physiological stress embedding" mechanisms (need biomarkers)
- ✗ Causal direction (does disability cause disease or vice versa?)

### Housing & Environment
✓ **Homeownership gaps** - 48.5% elderly vs 25.2% general own homes
✓ **Disaster exposure** - 11.4% elderly vs 2.5% general experienced disasters
✓ **Pollution health problems** - Self-reported environmental health issues

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "House-rich but cash-poor" (need asset vs liquid wealth data)
- ✗ Mortgage discrimination (need bank lending data)
- ✗ "Historical urban development patterns" (need urban planning records)

### Violence & Safety
✓ **Violence rates measured** - 29.2% LGBT+ vs 17.2% general psychological violence
✓ **Discrimination measured** - Self-reported discrimination incidents
✓ **Correlation** - LGBT+ have both higher violence AND higher discrimination

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "Family rejection" as specific cause (need family dynamic data)
- ✗ "Hate crimes" vs other violence (no perpetrator motive data)
- ✗ "Underreporting" severity (would need validation study)

### Family & Household
✓ **Household composition** - 12.3% elderly vs 64% general have children in HH
✓ **Household size** - 3.7 vs 3.9 persons average
✓ **Marriage rates** - 12% LGBT+ vs 36.9% general married

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "Adult children urban migration" (need migration data)
- ✗ "Societal doubts about disabled parenting" (need attitude surveys)
- ✗ "Family rejection" for LGBT+ (need qualitative data)

### Food Security
✓ **Food worry rates** - 20% LGBT+ vs 13.7% general worry about food
✓ **Meal skipping** - 13% LGBT+ vs 7.6% general skip meals
✓ **Paradox confirmed** - Elderly have lower income BUT lower food insecurity

**CANNOT verify from survey:**
- ✗ "Normalized hunger" explanation (need qualitative data)
- ✗ "Cheap calories" diet composition (no dietary intake data)
- ✗ "Food deserts" (need geographic food access mapping)

## Recommended Revisions

### Strategy
1. **Lead with data** - Start with verified statistics
2. **Use cautious language** for interpretations:
   - "This pattern suggests..." instead of "This reveals..."
   - "Possible explanations include..." instead of "This is caused by..."
   - "Consistent with..." instead of "This proves..."
3. **Separate data from interpretation**
4. **Cite when using external research**
5. **Acknowledge data limitations**

### Example Revision

**CURRENT (Over-interpreted):**
> "The 87.5 pp contract gap for elderly workers suggests age discrimination pushes older workers into informal arrangements"

**REVISED (Evidence-based):**
> "Only 8.4% of employed elderly have formal contracts compared to 95.9% of the general population - a 87.5 pp gap. While our survey cannot identify the causes, this pattern is consistent with research on age-based employment barriers in Thailand's labor market."

**CURRENT (Speculative):**
> "After decades of economic marginalization, elderly may have normalized hunger, lowered expectations about nutrition"

**REVISED (Data-focused):**
> "Elderly report lower food insecurity (4.7% vs 13.7%) despite having dramatically lower incomes (14,770 THB vs 30,543 THB monthly). This paradox suggests complex relationships between income, food access, and reporting that warrant further investigation."

## Proposal

Should I revise all 8 domain narratives to:
1. Lead with verified survey statistics
2. Use cautious interpretive language
3. Clearly separate data from speculation
4. Acknowledge what we cannot verify
5. Keep insights but frame them as "possible explanations" rather than proven facts?
