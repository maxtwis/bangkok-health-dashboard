## 1. CHRONIC DISEASE → HEALTH BEHAVIORS (EXERCISE)

### Finding: People with chronic diseases exercise significantly less than those without

**Elderly Population** (n=2,986, p<0.001***)
- WITHOUT chronic disease: 48.2% exercise regularly (n=635)
- WITH chronic disease: 37.1% exercise regularly (n=2,351)
- **Difference: -11.1 percentage points**

**Disabled Population** (n=638, p<0.001***)
- WITHOUT chronic disease: 43.0% exercise regularly (n=149)
- WITH chronic disease: 26.8% exercise regularly (n=489)
- **Difference: -16.2 percentage points**

**Informal Workers** (n=2,645, p<0.001***)
- WITHOUT chronic disease: 50.5% exercise regularly (n=1,290)
- WITH chronic disease: 40.3% exercise regularly (n=1,355)
- **Difference: -10.2 percentage points**

**Narrative Implication:** Chronic disease significantly reduces physical activity across all vulnerable populations, with the disabled population showing the largest effect (-16.2pp). This suggests a need for adapted exercise programs for people with chronic conditions.

## 2. INCOME → FOOD SECURITY

### Finding: Income level correlates with food insecurity, but the relationship is complex

**Elderly Population** (n=863, p=0.007**)
- Low income (avg: 291 THB/month): 8.7% food insecure (n=346)
- Medium income (avg: 553 THB/month): 2.6% food insecure (n=229)
- High income (avg: 12,478 THB/month): 4.9% food insecure (n=288)
- **Pattern: Medium income shows lowest food insecurity**

**Disabled Population** (n=152, p=0.031*)
- Low income (avg: 330 THB/month): 14.3% food insecure (n=56)
- Medium income (avg: 8,465 THB/month): 31.1% food insecure (n=45)
- High income (avg: 34,098 THB/month): 11.8% food insecure (n=51)
- **Pattern: Unexpected U-shaped relationship**

**Informal Workers** (n=2,048, p<0.001***)
- Low income (avg: 368 THB/month): 8.3% food insecure (n=949)
- Medium income (avg: 4,753 THB/month): 6.7% food insecure (n=613)
- High income (avg: 30,983 THB/month): 16.9% food insecure (n=486)
- **Pattern: High-income informal workers show highest insecurity**

**Narrative Implication:** The income-food security relationship is not linear. Among informal workers, high income earners show paradoxically high food insecurity (16.9%), possibly due to income volatility or irregular work patterns. This challenges simple income-based interventions.

## 3. HOUSING OWNERSHIP → INCOME

### Finding: Home ownership correlates with higher income

**General Population** (n=1,279, p=0.046*)
- Homeowners: 26,687 THB/month (n=992)
- Renters: 23,855 THB/month (n=287)
- **Difference: +2,832 THB/month**

**Elderly Population** (n=863, p=0.007**)
- Homeowners: 5,322 THB/month (n=371)
- Renters: 3,753 THB/month (n=492)
- **Difference: +1,568 THB/month**

**Narrative Implication:** Home ownership is associated with higher income, particularly among the elderly (+1,568 THB/month). This may reflect accumulated wealth over time or serve as a protective factor against poverty.

## 4. HOUSING OWNERSHIP → CHRONIC DISEASE

### Finding: Home ownership paradoxically correlates with higher chronic disease rates

**Disabled Population** (n=638, p=0.002**)
- Homeowners: 85.0% have chronic disease (n=193)
- Renters: 73.0% have chronic disease (n=445)
- **Difference: +12.0 percentage points**

**Informal Workers** (n=2,645, p<0.001***)
- Homeowners: 60.0% have chronic disease (n=821)
- Renters: 47.3% have chronic disease (n=1,824)
- **Difference: +12.7 percentage points**

**Narrative Implication:** Homeowners show higher chronic disease rates, likely reflecting age confounding (older people own homes and have more chronic diseases) rather than causation. This highlights the importance of age-adjusted analysis.

## 5. EDUCATION → HEALTHCARE ACCESS (MEDICAL CARE AVOIDANCE)

### Finding: Lower education correlates with skipping medical care

**Elderly Population** (n=2,986, p<0.001***)
- Low education: 17.3% skipped medical care (n=2,208)
- Medium education: 11.9% skipped medical care (n=486)
- High education: 7.2% skipped medical care (n=292)
- **Difference: 10.1 percentage points (Low vs High)**

**Narrative Implication:** Education shows a clear gradient effect on healthcare access. Elderly with low education are 2.4x more likely to skip medical care than those with high education, suggesting education-based health literacy interventions could improve access.

## 6. INCOME → HEALTHCARE ACCESS (MEDICAL CARE AVOIDANCE)

### Finding: Low income dramatically increases medical care avoidance

**Elderly Population** (n=863, p<0.001***)
- Low income (avg: 291 THB): 44.8% skipped care (n=346)
- Medium income (avg: 553 THB): 9.6% skipped care (n=229)
- High income (avg: 12,478 THB): 9.7% skipped care (n=288)
- **Difference: 35.2 percentage points (Low vs High)**

**Disabled Population** (n=152, p=0.017*)
- Low income (avg: 330 THB): 53.6% skipped care (n=56)
- Medium income (avg: 8,465 THB): 26.7% skipped care (n=45)
- High income (avg: 34,098 THB): 35.3% skipped care (n=51)
- **Difference: 18.3 percentage points (Low vs Medium)**

**Informal Workers** (n=2,048, p<0.001***)
- Low income (avg: 368 THB): 39.4% skipped care (n=949)
- Medium income (avg: 4,753 THB): 13.1% skipped care (n=613)
- High income (avg: 30,983 THB): 23.7% skipped care (n=486)
- **Difference: 26.3 percentage points (Low vs Medium)**

**Narrative Implication:** Income is the strongest predictor of healthcare access. Low-income elderly have a shocking 44.8% rate of skipping medical care, and low-income disabled people skip care at 53.6%. This represents a major healthcare access crisis requiring immediate intervention.

## 7. EDUCATION → INCOME

### Finding: Education strongly predicts income across all populations

**General Population** (n=1,279, p<0.001***)
- Low education: 15,357 THB/month (n=47)
- Medium education: 25,545 THB/month (n=489)
- High education: 27,062 THB/month (n=743)
- **Difference: +11,704 THB (High vs Low)**

**Elderly Population** (n=863, p<0.001***)
- Low education: 2,797 THB/month (n=660)
- Medium education: 7,714 THB/month (n=140)
- High education: 14,203 THB/month (n=63)
- **Difference: +11,406 THB (High vs Low)**

**Informal Workers** (n=2,048, p<0.001***)
- Low education: 2,943 THB/month (n=1,148)
- Medium education: 14,427 THB/month (n=588)
- High education: 20,699 THB/month (n=312)
- **Difference: +17,756 THB (High vs Low)**

**Narrative Implication:** Education shows the strongest income effect among informal workers (+17,756 THB), suggesting that education-based interventions could substantially improve economic outcomes for this vulnerable group. Even among elderly, high education yields 5x higher income than low education.

## KEY CROSS-DOMAIN PATHWAYS

### Pathway 1: Education → Income → Healthcare Access
- **Higher education** leads to **higher income** (+11,000-18,000 THB)
- **Higher income** leads to **better healthcare access** (35pp reduction in care avoidance)
- **Effect size:** Education indirectly improves healthcare access through income

### Pathway 2: Income → Food Security + Healthcare Access
- **Low income** simultaneously causes:
  - High food insecurity (8-14% for elderly/disabled)
  - High medical care avoidance (40-54%)
- **Implication:** Income interventions have dual health benefits

### Pathway 3: Chronic Disease → Reduced Physical Activity
- **Chronic disease** reduces exercise by **10-16 percentage points**
- **Effect is strongest among disabled** (-16.2pp)
- **Implication:** Disease management programs must include physical activity support

### Pathway 4: Informal Work → Economic Vulnerability
- **Informal workers** show:
  - High income volatility (food insecurity at all income levels)
  - Lower education-to-income returns
  - Higher medical care avoidance rates
- **Implication:** Formalization and worker protection policies are critical
