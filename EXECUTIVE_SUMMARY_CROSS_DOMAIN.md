## Key Findings: 7 Significant Cross-Domain Relationships

### 1. INCOME IS THE CRITICAL HEALTHCARE ACCESS BARRIER ⚠️
**Most Important Finding**

| Population | Low-Income Skip Care | High-Income Skip Care | Gap | Significance |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|--------------|
| **Disabled** | **53.6%** (330 THB/mo) | 35.3% (34,098 THB/mo) | **18.3pp** | p=0.017 |
| **Elderly** | **44.8%** (291 THB/mo) | 9.7% (12,478 THB/mo) | **35.2pp** | p<0.001 |
| **Informal Workers** | **39.4%** (368 THB/mo) | 23.7% (30,983 THB/mo) | **15.7pp** | p<0.001 |

**What This Means:**
- Over **half of low-income disabled** people skip medical care
- Low-income elderly skip care at **4.6 times** the rate of high-income elderly
- Income is the single strongest predictor of healthcare access

**Policy Urgency:** HIGH - This represents a healthcare access crisis requiring immediate intervention

### 2. EDUCATION YIELDS MASSIVE INCOME RETURNS
**Highest Leverage Intervention Point**

| Population | Low Education Income | High Education Income | Income Gain | ROI Multiple |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Informal Workers** | 2,943 THB/mo | 20,699 THB/mo | **+17,756 THB** | **7.0x** |
| **Elderly** | 2,797 THB/mo | 14,203 THB/mo | **+11,406 THB** | **5.1x** |
| **General** | 15,357 THB/mo | 27,062 THB/mo | **+11,704 THB** | **1.8x** |

**What This Means:**
- Education shows **strongest returns among informal workers** (+17,756 THB = 7x income gain)
- Education → Income → Healthcare Access (cascading pathway)
- Education interventions have multiplier effects across domains

**Policy Urgency:** HIGH - Education is the upstream lever for economic and health improvements

---

### 3. INCOME VOLATILITY DRIVES FOOD INSECURITY (PARADOXICAL FINDING)
**Challenges Income-Based Interventions**

**Among Informal Workers (n=2,048, p<0.001):**
- **Low income** (368 THB/mo): **8.3%** food insecure
- Medium income (4,753 THB/mo): 6.7% food insecure
- **High income** (30,983 THB/mo): **16.9%** food insecure ⚠️

**What This Means:**
- High-income informal workers show **2x higher** food insecurity than low-income workers
- Income **volatility** matters more than income **level** for food security
- Simple income-based interventions may miss high-earning but unstable workers

**Policy Urgency:** MEDIUM - Requires income-smoothing mechanisms, not just income support

---

### 4. CHRONIC DISEASE REDUCES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
**Vicious Cycle of Health Decline**

| Population | Exercise w/o Disease | Exercise w/ Disease | Reduction | Significance |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Disabled** | 43.0% | 26.8% | **-16.2pp** | p<0.001 |
| **Elderly** | 48.2% | 37.1% | **-11.1pp** | p<0.001 |
| **Informal Workers** | 50.5% | 40.3% | **-10.2pp** | p<0.001 |

**What This Means:**
- Chronic disease reduces exercise by **10-16 percentage points**
- Creates negative feedback loop: disease → less exercise → worse health
- **Disabled show largest effect** (-16.2pp), compounding their challenges

**Policy Urgency:** MEDIUM - Need adapted exercise programs for chronically ill

---

### 5. EDUCATION REDUCES HEALTHCARE AVOIDANCE
**Health Literacy Pathway**

**Among Elderly (n=2,986, p<0.001):**
- **Low education:** 17.3% skip medical care
- Medium education: 11.9% skip care
- **High education:** 7.2% skip care
- **Gap:** -10.1 percentage points

**What This Means:**
- Low-educated elderly are **2.4 times more likely** to skip care than high-educated
- Education operates through health literacy and system navigation
- Education affects healthcare access both directly and through income

**Policy Urgency:** MEDIUM - Health literacy programs can improve access

---

### 6. HOME OWNERSHIP CORRELATES WITH INCOME
**Housing as Economic Security**

| Population | Homeowner Income | Renter Income | Income Premium | Significance |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Elderly** | 5,322 THB/mo | 3,753 THB/mo | **+1,568 THB (42%)** | p=0.007 |
| **General** | 26,687 THB/mo | 23,855 THB/mo | **+2,832 THB (12%)** | p=0.046 |

**What This Means:**
- Homeowners earn significantly more, especially elderly (+42%)
- Housing functions as wealth accumulation and poverty protection
- Elderly homeowners may have lower housing costs, improving economic security

**Policy Urgency:** LOW - Informative but not urgent intervention point

---

### 7. HOME OWNERSHIP CORRELATES WITH CHRONIC DISEASE
**Age Confounding - Use Cautiously**

| Population | Homeowners w/ Disease | Renters w/ Disease | Gap | Significance |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|-----|--------------|
| **Disabled** | 85.0% | 73.0% | **+12.0pp** | p=0.002 |
| **Informal Workers** | 60.0% | 47.3% | **+12.7pp** | p<0.001 |

**What This Means:**
- Homeowners show higher chronic disease rates
- **Likely reflects age confounding:** older people own homes AND have more chronic disease
- Not a causal relationship - use as demographic marker only

**Policy Urgency:** LOW - Informational, target health services to older homeowners

---

## Critical Cross-Domain Pathways

### Pathway 1: Education → Income → Healthcare Access
**The Upstream Intervention Cascade**

1. **Education → Income**
   - +11,000 to +18,000 THB income gain (p<0.001)
   - Strongest among informal workers (+17,756 THB)

2. **Income → Healthcare Access**
   - -35 percentage points care avoidance (p<0.001)
   - Low-income elderly: 44.8% skip care
   - High-income elderly: 9.7% skip care

3. **Combined Effect**
   - Education indirectly improves healthcare through income pathway
   - Education also has direct effect through health literacy (-10.1pp care avoidance)

**Policy Implication:** Education interventions yield triple benefits: economic security + health literacy + healthcare access

---

### Pathway 2: Chronic Disease → Reduced Exercise → Worsening Health
**The Vicious Cycle**

1. **Chronic Disease → Reduced Physical Activity**
   - -10 to -16 percentage points (p<0.001)
   - Strongest among disabled (-16.2pp)

2. **Reduced Activity → Disease Progression**
   - Physical inactivity worsens chronic conditions (established literature)
   - Creates reinforcing negative cycle

**Policy Implication:** Chronic disease management must include adapted physical activity programs to break the cycle

---

### Pathway 3: Informal Work → Income Volatility → Food Insecurity
**Why Income Level Isn't Enough**

1. **Informal Work → Income Volatility**
   - Irregular work patterns create unpredictable income
   - Not captured in single-point income measures

2. **Income Volatility → Food Insecurity**
   - High-income informal workers: 16.9% food insecure
   - Low-income informal workers: 8.3% food insecure
   - Paradox: higher earners more insecure

**Policy Implication:** Need income-smoothing (emergency funds, insurance) not just income support

---
