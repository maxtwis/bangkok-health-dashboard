# Complete Summary of Income-Related Corrections

## Critical Issue Discovered
The `income` column in survey_sampling.csv mixes TWO different units:
- **income_type = 1**: Daily income (THB/day)
- **income_type = 2**: Monthly income (THB/month)

All income analyses must convert daily income to monthly equivalent (daily × 30 days) before any comparisons or categorizations.

## Section 1: HEALTHCARE ACCESS DOMAIN ✅ CORRECTED

### Medical Care Skipping by Income

| Population Group | Low Income (<10K/mo) | Higher Income (≥10K/mo) | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disabled | **61.1%** skip | 23.4% skip | **37.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | **43.6%** skip | 12.7% skip | **30.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal | **49.4%** skip | 18.7% skip | **30.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | **62.5%** skip | 42.7% skip | **19.8 pp** | 0.043 |

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTED in report**

**What changed**:
- OLD (wrong): Used raw income column without conversion
- NEW (correct): Converted daily to monthly, properly categorized <10K vs ≥10K
- **Impact**: Gaps are MUCH LARGER than originally reported
  - Disabled: 26.1 pp → **37.7 pp** (+11.6 pp)
  - Elderly: 16.6 pp → **30.9 pp** (+14.3 pp)
  - Informal: 8.7 pp → **30.7 pp** (+22.0 pp!)
  - LGBT+: 8.0 pp (n.s.) → **19.8 pp (significant!)**

**Key Finding**: More than 60% of low-income disabled and LGBT+ individuals skip medical care due to cost - a healthcare access crisis.

## Section 2: EMPLOYMENT & INCOME DOMAIN ✅ CORRECTED

### Average Monthly Income

| Group | Monthly Income | vs General | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| General | 30,543 THB | - | - |
| Elderly | 14,770 THB | -51.6% | -15,773 THB |
| Disabled | 20,252 THB | -33.7% | -10,291 THB |

**Status**: ✅ **Already correct in report** (these were always monthly)

### Education-Income Relationship (Elderly)

**❌ OLD CLAIM (WRONG)**:
- Primary education: 2,797 THB
- Higher education: 9,728 THB
- Gap: 6,931 THB (3.5× difference)

**✅ CORRECTED**:
- Primary education: **13,563 THB**
- Higher education: **14,885 THB**
- Gap: **1,322 THB** (10% difference)

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTED in report**

**Impact**: The education-income gap is **MUCH SMALLER** than originally reported. Education alone has only modest income effects (10% difference), suggesting other factors matter more.

---

### Contract-Income Relationship (Employed Elderly)

**❌ OLD CLAIM (WRONG)**:
- With contract: 14,654 THB
- Without contract: 3,553 THB
- Gap: 11,101 THB (4.1× difference)

**✅ CORRECTED**:
- With contract: **20,581 THB**
- Without contract: **14,273 THB**
- Gap: **6,308 THB** (44% higher)

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTED in report**

**Impact**: Contract status has a **STRONGER** income effect (44% increase) than education (10% increase), though the gap is smaller in absolute terms than originally reported.

**New Insight**: The corrected data shows that **employment formality (contract) matters MORE than education** for elderly income - contract status shows 44% income difference vs only 10% for education.

## Section 3: FOOD SECURITY DOMAIN ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT

### Informal Workers - Income Paradox

| Income Level | Food Insecurity Rate |
|---|---|
| Low income (<10K/mo) | 9.1% |
| Higher income (≥10K/mo) | 9.3% |
| **Difference** | **0.3 pp** (essentially none) |

**Status**: ✅ **Data in report is CORRECT**

**Interpretation**: The paradox remains - there is virtually NO income effect on food insecurity among informal workers. This suggests:
1. Income volatility (not level) may drive food insecurity
2. Both groups experience episodic food insecurity
3. Other factors (household size, debt, expenses) may matter more than income

## Files Updated

## Next Steps for Thai Report

The Thai version needs the same corrections:
1. Healthcare Access table (lines ~120-130)
2. Employment & Income section (education and contract gaps)
3. Education & Skills section (same income values)

## Key Takeaways

### What We Learned:
1. **Always check data types and units** - mixing daily/monthly income caused massive errors
2. **Income effect is STRONGER than reported** - especially for medical care skipping
3. **Education effect is WEAKER than reported** - only 10% income difference
4. **Contract status is MORE important than education** - 44% income boost vs 10%

### Most Important Finding:
**Low-income vulnerable populations face catastrophic healthcare access barriers** despite universal coverage:
- 61.1% of low-income disabled skip care
- 62.5% of low-income LGBT+ skip care
- 49.4% of low-income informal workers skip care
- 43.6% of low-income elderly skip care

These rates are 2-3× higher than their higher-income counterparts within the same vulnerable groups.
