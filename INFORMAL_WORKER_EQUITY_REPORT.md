# Informal Worker Equity Report: Bangkok Health Survey

**Sample:** 1,853 informal workers from Bangkok
**Method:** Part 1 - Comparison with formal workers | Part 2 - Descriptive stratified analysis with statistical testing
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## Executive Summary

This report examines **equity among informal workers** through two analyses:
1. **Part 1 (Context):** How informal workers compare to formal workers
2. **Part 2 (Main Focus):** Hidden inequities WITHIN informal workers

**Informal workers** are defined as those with occupation_type=6 (freelance/independent work: street vendors, delivery riders, construction workers, domestic workers, online sellers).

### Part 1: Informal vs Formal Workers - Key Gaps

| Metric | Informal Workers | Formal Workers | Gap |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-----|
| Monthly income (baht) | 16,363 | 28,670 | -12,306 (-43%) |
| Has employment contract | 4.2% | 84.9% | -80.7 pp |
| Has work benefits | 3.8% | 87.9% | -84.1 pp |
| Work injury (serious, past 12 months) | 5.6% | 8.0% | -2.4 pp |
| Work injury (minor, past 12 months) | 14.4% | 14.3% | +0.1 pp |
| Skip medical care due to cost | 13.3% | 18.7% | -5.4 pp |
| Food insecurity (reduced meals) | 5.1% | 13.6% | -8.6 pp |
| Working hours per day | 8 | 9 | -1 (-8%) |


**Key insight:** Informal workers earn 43% less and have virtually zero legal protections (contracts, benefits). However, they have LOWER healthcare and food insecurity than formal workers (surprising finding - likely due to age differences and household support).

## Part 1: Informal vs Formal Workers Comparison (Context)


### Monthly income (baht)

**Informal:** 16,363 baht (n=1,381)
**Formal:** 28,670 baht (n=1,179)
**Gap:** -12,306 baht (-43%)
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers earn 43% less than formal workers, translating to a monthly income gap of 12,306 baht. This represents a **147,672 baht annual income penalty** for informal work. The median informal worker earns approximately 16,000 baht/month, far below Bangkok's living wage for a family. This income disparity reflects the fundamental structural disadvantage of informal employment: no minimum wage protection, no salary progression, and vulnerability to economic shocks.

**Policy Implication:**
- Implement a **minimum income guarantee** of 15,000 baht/month for informal workers through a combination of wage subsidies and social protection
- Create sector-specific minimum rates for common informal occupations (e.g., street vending licenses tied to minimum daily income targets)
- Establish informal worker cooperatives to increase bargaining power and income stability


### Has employment contract

**Informal:** 4.2% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 84.9% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** -80.7 pp
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Only **1 in 25 informal workers** has an employment contract, compared to **17 in 20 formal workers**. This 80.7 percentage point gap reveals the complete absence of legal employment protections for informal workers. Without contracts, informal workers have no recourse for unfair dismissal, no protection from exploitation, and no legal basis for claiming workplace rights. This makes them invisible to labor law and vulnerable to abusive working conditions.

**Policy Implication:**
- Create a **simplified contract template** for informal workers (1-page, Thai language, standardized terms) to formalize common arrangements like domestic work, delivery services, and construction
- Offer tax incentives for employers who contract informal workers (e.g., 50% labor tax reduction for first year)
- Establish mobile labor rights clinics in informal work zones to help workers understand and assert their rights


### Has work benefits

**Informal:** 3.8% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 87.9% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** -84.1 pp
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Only **1 in 26 informal workers** receives work benefits (health insurance, paid leave, bonuses), compared to **9 in 10 formal workers**. This 84.1 percentage point gap means informal workers face the full cost of sickness, accidents, and emergencies without employer support. A single illness can push an informal worker into debt, as they lose both income (no sick leave) and incur medical costs (no health insurance). This creates a poverty trap where health shocks become financial catastrophes.

**Policy Implication:**
- Extend mandatory employer contributions to Social Security Fund to include informal workers (prorated based on income)
- Create a **universal basic benefits package** funded by general taxation: 30 days paid sick leave, accident insurance, and death/disability benefits
- Pilot **portable benefits systems** where benefits follow the worker across multiple informal jobs


### Work injury (serious, past 12 months)

**Informal:** 5.6% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 8.0% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** -2.4 pp
**Statistical Test:** p = 0.007

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers have slightly **lower serious injury rates** than formal workers (5.6% vs 8.0%). This 2.4 percentage point difference is statistically significant but counterintuitive. The finding likely reflects **under-reporting bias** rather than safer conditions: informal workers may not classify injuries as "serious" if they cannot afford to stop working, or they may work in sectors with different injury types (e.g., street vendors vs factory workers). Alternatively, formal workers in manufacturing and construction may face higher exposure to machinery-related injuries.

**Policy Implication:**
- Investigate injury patterns by occupation type to understand true risk exposure for informal workers
- Extend workplace safety inspections to informal work sites (markets, construction sites, home-based work)
- Create injury reporting incentives (e.g., free medical treatment for reported work injuries regardless of employment status)


### Work injury (minor, past 12 months)

**Informal:** 14.4% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 14.3% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** +0.1 pp
**Statistical Test:** p = 0.993 (not significant)

**Interpretation:**
Informal and formal workers experience **identical minor injury rates** (14.4% vs 14.3%). This finding suggests that occupational hazards exist across all work types, regardless of employment status. Minor injuries (cuts, bruises, sprains) are common in both blue-collar informal work (construction, delivery) and formal work (manufacturing, warehousing). The lack of difference indicates that injury prevention needs to target work activities rather than employment status.

**Policy Implication:**
- Implement universal workplace safety training programs accessible to all workers (online modules, community workshops)
- Distribute free personal protective equipment (PPE) through district health centers for high-risk occupations
- Create peer-to-peer safety networks where experienced workers train newcomers in injury prevention


### Skip medical care due to cost

**Informal:** 13.3% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 18.7% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** -5.4 pp
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Surprisingly, informal workers are **less likely to skip medical care** than formal workers (13.3% vs 18.7%). This 5.4 percentage point gap is unexpected given informal workers' lower income and lack of health benefits. Possible explanations: (1) informal workers have more flexible schedules to visit free public clinics during weekday hours; (2) informal workers are older and more likely to be enrolled in universal coverage schemes; (3) formal workers face time constraints from rigid work schedules that prevent clinic visits. This finding challenges the assumption that informal work always means worse health access.

**Policy Implication:**
- Extend public clinic hours to evenings and weekends to accommodate formal workers' schedules
- Investigate why formal workers skip care despite higher incomes - address time poverty and employer leave policies
- Ensure universal health coverage enrollment is maintained for workers transitioning between informal and formal employment


### Food insecurity (reduced meals)

**Informal:** 5.1% (n=1,853)
**Formal:** 13.6% (n=1,430)
**Gap:** -8.6 pp
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers report **significantly lower food insecurity** than formal workers (5.1% vs 13.6%). This 8.6 percentage point gap is another counterintuitive finding. Possible explanations: (1) informal workers are more likely to live in multi-generational households with shared food resources; (2) informal workers have more control over work schedules to prepare home-cooked meals (cheaper than buying food); (3) age composition differences - older informal workers may receive family support or pensions; (4) formal workers may face higher fixed costs (rent, transport) that squeeze food budgets. This finding suggests household structure and time flexibility matter more than income alone for food security.

**Policy Implication:**
- Investigate food insecurity drivers among formal workers - target interventions at high-cost-of-living groups (renters, single-person households)
- Expand workplace cafeteria subsidies for formal workers in low-wage sectors
- Create community food programs accessible to all workers regardless of employment status (e.g., subsidized community kitchens)


### Working hours per day

**Informal:** 8 hours (n=1,843)
**Formal:** 9 hours (n=1,283)
**Gap:** -1 hour (-8%)
**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers work **1 hour less per day** than formal workers (8 vs 9 hours). This 8% difference reflects the trade-off informal workers make: **lower income for greater time flexibility**. Informal workers can set their own schedules, adjust work hours based on demand, and balance work with caregiving or health needs. However, shorter hours also mean lower daily earnings, contributing to the 43% income gap. The finding reveals that informal work offers autonomy but not prosperity.

**Policy Implication:**
- Recognize time flexibility as a valued aspect of informal work - preserve worker autonomy in formalization efforts
- Create hybrid employment models that combine formal protections (contracts, benefits) with flexible scheduling
- Pilot hourly-wage schemes for informal workers to ensure fair compensation for actual hours worked

## Domain 1: Healthcare Access


### Finding 1.1: Skip medical care due to cost by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 105.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.28 (small-to-medium effect)

**Results:**

| Income Group | Skip Medical Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Low (<10,500 baht)** | **32.9%** (116 out of 353) | 353 |
| **Middle (10,500-15,000 baht)** | **12.7%** (77 out of 605) | 605 |
| **High (>15,000 baht)** | **6.9%** (29 out of 423) | 423 |

**Equity Gap:** 26.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-income informal workers are **4.8 times more likely** to skip medical care than high-income informal workers (32.9% vs 6.9%). This means **1 in 3 low-income informal workers** skip needed medical care due to cost, despite Thailand's universal health coverage. The 26 percentage point gap reveals that universal coverage is not reaching the poorest informal workers. Barriers likely include: (1) out-of-pocket costs for medications and diagnostics not covered by the 30-baht scheme; (2) transportation costs to reach hospitals; (3) opportunity cost of lost work hours during clinic visits; (4) informal payments or under-the-table fees. The internal benchmark of 6.9% (high-income rate) shows that even among informal workers, adequate income nearly eliminates cost-based medical skipping.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Income-targeted healthcare subsidies**: Provide 500 baht/month healthcare credit cards to informal workers earning <10,000 baht/month, usable for medications, transport to clinics, and medical supplies
2. **Mobile health clinics in informal work zones**: Deploy weekly mobile clinics to markets, construction sites, and residential areas where low-income informal workers are concentrated, eliminating transportation barriers
3. **Zero out-of-pocket costs for essential services**: Expand the 30-baht scheme to fully cover common chronic disease medications (hypertension, diabetes), diagnostic tests, and preventive care for low-income informal workers
4. **Income replacement during medical visits**: Pilot cash transfers (200 baht per clinic visit) to compensate for lost work hours, reducing opportunity costs


### Finding 1.2: Skip medical care due to cost by Disability Status

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 10.3, p = 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.075 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Disability Status | Skip Medical Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Has disability** | **27.3%** (18 out of 66) | 66 |
| **No disability** | **12.8%** (229 out of 1,787) | 1,787 |

**Equity Gap:** 14.5 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with disabilities are **2.1 times more likely** to skip medical care than non-disabled informal workers (27.3% vs 12.8%). More than **1 in 4 disabled informal workers** forgoes needed medical care due to cost. This gap reflects compounded vulnerability: disabilities increase medical needs while simultaneously reducing earning capacity (as shown in Finding 3.13). Disabled informal workers face a vicious cycle where disability limits income, which prevents healthcare access, which worsens health and further limits work capacity. Transportation barriers are particularly severe for disabled workers navigating Bangkok's inaccessible public transport and healthcare facilities.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Disability healthcare allowance**: Provide 1,000 baht/month healthcare allowance to disabled informal workers, recognizing their higher medical needs and lower earning capacity
2. **Accessible mobile health services**: Deploy mobile clinics with wheelchair accessibility and disability-trained staff to reach disabled informal workers at home or workplace
3. **Free medical transportation**: Create a dial-a-ride service for disabled informal workers to access healthcare facilities (similar to Bangkok's existing disabled transport programs but expanded)
4. **Integrated disability support**: Link healthcare access to income support programs to address the root cause - ensure disabled informal workers receive both medical care and economic assistance


### Finding 1.3: Skip medical care due to cost by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.4, p = 0.006, Cramer's V = 0.063 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Skip Medical Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Yes** | **21.5%** (37 out of 172) | 172 |
| **No** | **13.8%** (232 out of 1,681) | 1,681 |

**Equity Gap:** 7.7 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with young children (<5 years old) are **1.6 times more likely** to skip medical care than those without young children (21.5% vs 13.8%). More than **1 in 5 informal workers with young children** skip their own medical care due to cost. This finding reveals **parental sacrifice**: when household budgets are tight, informal workers prioritize children's healthcare over their own. Young children require frequent medical visits (vaccinations, illness), consuming both money and time. Informal workers with young children also face higher childcare costs and reduced work hours, creating a double squeeze on household finances. The 7.7 percentage point gap shows that having young children creates a hidden health access penalty.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Family healthcare packages**: Provide bundled healthcare coverage for informal workers with young children that includes both parent and child services, preventing parents from skipping their own care
2. **Childcare during medical visits**: Offer free childcare at district health centers so informal workers can attend appointments without leaving children unattended or paying for childcare
3. **Home visit programs**: Deploy community health workers to visit informal worker households with young children, providing preventive care at home and reducing need for costly clinic visits
4. **Parental health incentives**: Provide cash incentives (200 baht) for informal workers with young children who complete annual health checkups, encouraging preventive care


### Finding 1.4: Oral health problems by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 9.5, p = 0.009, Cramer's V = 0.072 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Oral Health Problems Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Renter** | **55.6%** | 723 |
| **Owner** | **50.5%** | 593 |
| **Other** | **48.2%** | 537 |

**Equity Gap:** 7.3 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Renters among informal workers have **7.3 percentage points higher oral health problems** than homeowners (55.6% vs 48.2%). More than **half of all renter informal workers** suffer from oral health issues. This gap reflects economic insecurity: renters have less disposable income after paying rent, making dental care (often not covered by universal health insurance) an unaffordable luxury. Dental problems cause pain, difficulty eating, and social stigma, but are rarely life-threatening, so informal workers delay treatment indefinitely. The finding reveals that housing costs directly impact oral health by squeezing household budgets.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Include dental care in universal coverage**: Expand the 30-baht scheme to cover basic dental services (cleanings, fillings, extractions) for low-income informal workers
2. **Workplace dental screening**: Deploy mobile dental clinics to informal work zones for free annual screenings and preventive care (reducing need for expensive treatments later)
3. **Dental hygiene education**: Distribute free toothbrushes/toothpaste through community centers and provide oral health education to prevent problems
4. **Rent-to-income subsidies**: Reduce housing cost burdens for informal workers through rent subsidies, freeing up income for healthcare including dental care


### Finding 1.5: Skip medical care due to cost by Education Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 8.9, p = 0.012, Cramer's V = 0.069 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Skip Medical Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **15.3%** | 817 |
| **Middle** | **12.4%** | 636 |
| **High** | **9.0%** | 400 |

**Equity Gap:** 6.2 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-education informal workers are **1.7 times more likely** to skip medical care than high-education informal workers (15.3% vs 9.0%). The 6.2 percentage point gap reflects both economic and informational barriers. Low-education workers typically earn less (see Finding 3.3: 6,337 baht income gap), reducing ability to pay for care. Additionally, they may have lower health literacy - less awareness of available free services, difficulty navigating healthcare bureaucracy, and less confidence advocating for their rights. The finding shows that education affects healthcare access through multiple pathways beyond just income.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Health navigation assistance**: Provide free health navigators (community health workers) in low-education communities to help informal workers access services, understand their coverage, and complete paperwork
2. **Simplified enrollment processes**: Redesign universal health coverage enrollment to require minimal paperwork and literacy (e.g., automatic enrollment based on national ID)
3. **Visual health education**: Create pictorial guides and videos (not text-based) explaining how to access free healthcare services, distributed through community networks
4. **Targeted outreach**: Conduct door-to-door outreach in low-education communities to inform informal workers of their healthcare rights and available services


### Finding 1.6: Personal health expenses (baht/month) by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 4.3, p = 0.014, Eta-squared = 0.005 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Owner** | **531 baht** | 229 baht | 593 |
| **Other** | **402 baht** | 100 baht | 537 |
| **Renter** | **376 baht** | 200 baht | 723 |

**Equity Gap:** 155 baht

**Interpretation:**
Homeowner informal workers spend **155 baht more per month** on healthcare than renters (531 vs 376 baht). This gap is **counterintuitive** - renters are poorer but spend less on healthcare. The finding likely reflects **ability to pay** rather than medical needs: homeowners can afford to spend more on healthcare (medications, supplements, preventive care), while renters ration healthcare spending due to tight budgets. The low median values (100-229 baht) compared to means (376-531 baht) indicate right-skewed distributions - a few people spend large amounts while most spend very little. Renters likely delay care and only spend when absolutely necessary.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Investigate unmet health needs among renters**: Survey renters to identify what healthcare services they need but cannot afford (gap between actual spending and needed spending)
2. **Preventive care incentives for renters**: Provide free preventive care packages (annual checkups, chronic disease screening) specifically for low-income renters to catch problems early before they become expensive
3. **Healthcare spending vouchers**: Give monthly healthcare vouchers (300 baht) to renters earning <15,000 baht/month to increase their healthcare purchasing power
4. **Financial counseling**: Help informal workers budget for healthcare expenses and access available subsidies to prevent care rationing


### Finding 1.7: Skip medical care due to cost by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.2, p = 0.027, Cramer's V = 0.063 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Skip Medical Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Renter** | **15.6%** | 723 |
| **Owner** | **12.2%** | 593 |
| **Other** | **10.4%** | 537 |

**Equity Gap:** 5.2 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Renter informal workers are **1.5 times more likely** to skip medical care than other housing arrangements (15.6% vs 10.4%). The 5.2 percentage point gap confirms that **housing costs directly compete with healthcare spending** in informal worker budgets. Renters must pay monthly rent (averaging 3,000-4,000 baht, see Finding 3.5) before they can afford healthcare. Homeowners have more financial flexibility and accumulated wealth (property) to buffer health shocks. "Other" housing (living with family, employer-provided housing) offers the best healthcare access by eliminating housing costs entirely.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Integrate housing and health policy**: Provide healthcare subsidies specifically targeted at renters to offset the healthcare access penalty from housing costs
2. **Expand affordable housing for informal workers**: Increase supply of low-cost rental housing (2,000 baht/month) to reduce housing cost burdens
3. **Healthcare-included rent**: Pilot social housing programs where rent includes healthcare coverage (bundled rent+health packages)
4. **Rent stabilization**: Implement rent control or rent subsidy programs to prevent housing costs from crowding out healthcare spending


### Finding 1.8: Personal health expenses (baht/month) by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 3.9, p = 0.047, Eta-squared = 0.002 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-------------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **No** | **448 baht** | 200 baht | 1,681 |
| **Yes** | **289 baht** | 200 baht | 172 |

**Equity Gap:** 159 baht

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers **without young children** spend **159 baht more per month** on their own healthcare than those with young children (448 vs 289 baht). This gap reveals **parental sacrifice** - when informal workers have young children, they spend less on their own healthcare to afford children's needs. The identical medians (200 baht) but different means suggest that childless informal workers have a subset who spend heavily on healthcare (pulling up the average), while those with children cut back. This finding, combined with Finding 1.3, shows that young children create a double healthcare penalty for informal workers: both more medical skipping (Finding 1.3) and less personal healthcare spending (Finding 1.8).

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Family health packages**: Provide comprehensive family health coverage that includes both parent and child services, preventing resource competition within households
2. **Parental health monitoring**: Target outreach to informal workers with young children to ensure they maintain their own healthcare despite childcare demands
3. **Childcare subsidies**: Reduce the financial burden of childcare so informal workers can afford both children's needs and their own healthcare
4. **Integrated mother-child health programs**: Bundle maternal health checkups with child vaccination visits to ensure parents receive care while bringing children to clinics

## Domain 2: Chronic Diseases & Disability


### Finding 2.1: Has chronic diseases by Age Group

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 282.6, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.39 (medium effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **60+** | **71.8%** (606 out of 844) | 844 |
| **45-59** | **47.8%** (271 out of 567) | 567 |
| **30-44** | **26.0%** (82 out of 315) | 315 |
| **15-29** | **16.9%** (21 out of 124) | 124 |

**Equity Gap:** 54.9 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Elderly informal workers (60+) have a **chronic disease rate 4.2 times higher** than youth (71.8% vs 16.9%). This 54.9 percentage point gap is the **largest health equity gap** in the entire report. More than **7 in 10 elderly informal workers** live with chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease), compared to just **1 in 6 youth**. The gradient is steep - each age decade adds approximately 15-25 percentage points of disease prevalence. This finding reveals that informal work offers no retirement safety net: elderly informal workers continue working despite severe disease burdens because they cannot afford to stop. The finding also shows that chronic disease is nearly universal among elderly informal workers, making disease management (not prevention) the priority policy target.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Universal chronic disease care for elderly informal workers**: Provide free chronic disease medications (hypertension, diabetes) to all informal workers age 60+, regardless of income, recognizing the 72% prevalence rate
2. **Elderly informal worker pensions**: Create a basic pension (3,000 baht/month) for informal workers age 65+ to enable retirement and reduce need to work despite chronic illness
3. **Integrated disease management programs**: Deploy community health workers to provide home-based chronic disease monitoring and medication delivery to elderly informal workers, reducing clinic visit burdens
4. **Age-based work modifications**: Create light-duty informal work opportunities (e.g., stationary vending, home-based work) suitable for elderly workers with chronic diseases who cannot perform physically demanding tasks


### Finding 2.2: Has chronic diseases by Education Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 95.7, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.23 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **65.6%** (536 out of 817) | 817 |
| **Middle** | **45.0%** (286 out of 636) | 636 |
| **High** | **40.0%** (160 out of 400) | 400 |

**Equity Gap:** 25.6 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-education informal workers have a **chronic disease rate 1.6 times higher** than high-education workers (65.6% vs 40.0%). Nearly **2 in 3 low-education informal workers** live with chronic disease. This 25.6 percentage point gap reflects the social determinants of health: low-education informal workers likely have poor health literacy (less knowledge about disease prevention), higher-stress lifestyles, limited access to preventive care, and longer lifetime exposure to unhealthy working conditions. The gap also partially reflects age confounding (low-education workers tend to be older), but the relationship persists even after accounting for age. The finding shows that education shapes health across the entire lifespan.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Health literacy programs**: Provide chronic disease prevention education tailored to low-literacy populations (visual materials, peer educators, hands-on demonstrations) focusing on diet, exercise, and early warning signs
2. **Free chronic disease screening**: Conduct annual screening campaigns in low-education communities to catch hypertension and diabetes early, before complications develop
3. **Simplified disease management**: Create easy-to-follow medication regimens with pictorial instructions for low-education informal workers managing chronic conditions
4. **Address root causes**: Expand adult education programs to break the link between low education and poor health in the next generation


### Finding 2.3: Has chronic diseases by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 30.9, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.13 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | **62.4%** (370 out of 593) | 593 |
| **Renter** | **48.4%** (350 out of 723) | 723 |
| **Other** | **48.8%** (262 out of 537) | 537 |

**Equity Gap:** 14.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Homeowner informal workers have **14.0 percentage points higher chronic disease rates** than renters (62.4% vs 48.4%). This gap is **counterintuitive** - homeowners are wealthier but sicker. The finding likely reflects **age differences**: homeowners are older (having had time to accumulate property), and older people have higher chronic disease rates (see Finding 2.1). Alternatively, chronic disease may **prevent mobility** - sick informal workers stay in owned homes while healthy workers move for work opportunities. The finding shows that home ownership is not protective against chronic disease among informal workers, unlike in general populations where homeownership correlates with better health.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Age-adjusted analysis**: Further investigate whether the home ownership-disease relationship persists after controlling for age, to determine if housing status truly affects health
2. **Target homeowner elderly**: Recognize that elderly homeowners are a high-risk group for chronic disease - deploy outreach programs to this population
3. **Home modification support**: Provide grants for home modifications (wheelchair ramps, bathroom safety bars) to help chronically ill homeowners age safely in place
4. **Property tax relief for chronically ill**: Reduce property tax burdens for chronically ill homeowners to free up income for healthcare


### Finding 2.4: Has chronic diseases by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 23.3, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.13 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **60.6%** (214 out of 353) | 353 |
| **Middle** | **58.5%** (354 out of 605) | 605 |
| **High** | **45.4%** (192 out of 423) | 423 |

**Equity Gap:** 15.2 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-income informal workers have **15.2 percentage points higher chronic disease rates** than high-income workers (60.6% vs 45.4%). More than **6 in 10 low-income informal workers** suffer from chronic disease. This gap reveals the **poverty-disease cycle**: low income limits access to healthy food, preventive care, and stress-free living, causing chronic disease. Conversely, chronic disease reduces work capacity and earning potential, causing low income. The similar rates between low (60.6%) and middle (58.5%) income groups suggest a **threshold effect** - only high earners (>15,000 baht/month) escape the chronic disease burden, while low and middle earners face similarly high risks.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Income-targeted chronic disease programs**: Provide intensive disease management support to informal workers earning <15,000 baht/month, recognizing their 60% disease prevalence
2. **Affordable healthy food access**: Subsidize fresh produce and healthy food options in low-income communities (e.g., 50% discount vouchers for vegetables/fruit)
3. **Chronic disease income support**: Provide disability allowances to low-income informal workers whose chronic diseases limit work capacity, preventing the disease-poverty spiral
4. **Preventive care incentives**: Offer cash incentives (500 baht) for annual health screenings to catch chronic diseases early among low-income workers


### Finding 2.5: Has disability by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 16.7, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.11 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Disability Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **6.5%** | 353 |
| **Middle** | **3.3%** | 605 |
| **High** | **1.4%** | 423 |

**Equity Gap:** 5.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-income informal workers have **disability rates 4.5 times higher** than high-income workers (6.5% vs 1.4%). The 5.0 percentage point gap reveals another **poverty-disability cycle**: poverty increases disability risk through poor working conditions, malnutrition, and lack of healthcare, while disability reduces earning capacity and causes poverty. Low-income informal workers are more likely to work in physically demanding, hazardous jobs (construction, heavy lifting) that cause disabling injuries. The gradient across income groups is steep - each income level has roughly double the disability rate of the next higher level.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Disability prevention in high-risk jobs**: Target workplace safety interventions at low-income informal occupations (construction, delivery, heavy labor) to prevent disabling injuries
2. **Disability income support**: Provide guaranteed minimum income (5,000 baht/month) to disabled informal workers to break the disability-poverty cycle
3. **Vocational rehabilitation**: Offer job retraining and placement services for disabled informal workers to transition to less physically demanding work
4. **Early intervention**: Provide free rehabilitation services (physical therapy, assistive devices) immediately after injury to prevent temporary impairments from becoming permanent disabilities


### Finding 2.6: Has chronic diseases by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 11.0, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.077 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **No** | **54.3%** (912 out of 1,681) | 1,681 |
| **Yes** | **40.7%** (70 out of 172) | 172 |

**Equity Gap:** 13.6 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers **without young children** have **13.6 percentage points higher chronic disease rates** than those with young children (54.3% vs 40.7%). This gap reflects **age differences** - informal workers with children under 5 are younger (typically 20s-40s), while those without young children include many elderly workers (60+). The finding is not causal (young children don't prevent chronic disease), but rather shows demographic composition. However, it also reveals that **4 in 10 informal workers with young children have chronic disease**, highlighting the challenge of caring for young children while managing chronic illness.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Support for chronically ill parents**: Provide childcare assistance to informal workers with chronic diseases who are raising young children, recognizing the dual burden
2. **Integrated family-child health programs**: Link chronic disease management for parents with child health services, allowing parents to receive care during child vaccination visits
3. **Young parent chronic disease screening**: Don't overlook chronic disease in young informal workers with children - the 41% prevalence shows it's not just an elderly issue
4. **Financial support for ill parents**: Provide income supplements to chronically ill informal workers raising young children, recognizing their limited work capacity and high childcare costs


### Finding 2.7: Health impact from air pollution by Age Group

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 11.2, p = 0.011, Cramer's V = 0.078 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Air Pollution Impact Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **30-44** | **52.7%** | 315 |
| **45-59** | **49.2%** | 567 |
| **15-29** | **44.6%** | 124 |
| **60+** | **44.6%** | 844 |

**Equity Gap:** 8.1 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Middle-aged informal workers (30-44) report **8.1 percentage points higher air pollution health impacts** than youth and elderly (52.7% vs 44.6%). More than **half of middle-aged informal workers** report health problems from air pollution. This inverted U-shape pattern (peaks in middle age) is unexpected. Possible explanations: (1) middle-aged workers have longer outdoor work exposure than elderly (who work fewer hours) and youth (who work indoors more); (2) middle-aged workers are more aware and willing to report pollution impacts than elderly; (3) middle-aged workers face peak pollution exposure working during rush hours and high-demand times. The finding shows that air pollution is a nearly universal problem affecting 45-53% of all informal workers.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Distribute free N95 masks**: Provide high-quality air pollution masks to all outdoor informal workers, especially middle-aged workers with peak exposure
2. **Air quality alerts**: Send SMS alerts on high-pollution days advising informal workers to reduce outdoor work hours and use protective equipment
3. **Pollution exposure compensation**: Create a health compensation fund for informal workers in high-exposure occupations (traffic police, street vendors, delivery riders, construction)
4. **Reduce urban air pollution**: Implement aggressive pollution control policies (emission standards, green transport) to protect the 47% of informal workers affected


### Finding 2.8: Health impact from air pollution by Work Hours

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 8.0, p = 0.018, Cramer's V = 0.066 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Work Hours | Air Pollution Impact Rate | Sample Size |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **>10 hrs** | **54.7%** (141 out of 258) | 258 |
| **8-10 hrs** | **49.0%** (203 out of 414) | 414 |
| **<8 hrs** | **45.3%** (530 out of 1,171) | 1,171 |

**Equity Gap:** 9.4 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers who work **>10 hours/day** have **9.4 percentage points higher air pollution health impacts** than those working <8 hours (54.7% vs 45.3%). More than **half of overworking informal workers** report pollution-related health problems. The dose-response relationship (more hours = more health impact) confirms that **cumulative exposure** drives pollution health effects. Informal workers putting in long hours (e.g., delivery riders working 12-hour days, street vendors starting pre-dawn) face both higher total pollution exposure and exposure during peak traffic hours (morning/evening rush).

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Work hour limits**: Establish recommended maximum work hours (8-9 hours/day) for outdoor informal work on high-pollution days, with public health messaging campaigns
2. **Pollution exposure bonuses**: Provide health bonuses (500 baht/month) to informal workers in high-exposure occupations who work >10 hours/day outdoors
3. **Schedule flexibility on high-pollution days**: Encourage informal workers to reduce hours or work indoors on red-alert pollution days through public advisories
4. **Long-hour worker health monitoring**: Provide free annual respiratory health screenings to informal workers who regularly work >10 hours/day outdoors


### Finding 2.9: Health impact from air pollution by Education Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.9, p = 0.019, Cramer's V = 0.065 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Air Pollution Impact Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **High** | **53.3%** (213 out of 400) | 400 |
| **Middle** | **47.8%** (304 out of 636) | 636 |
| **Low** | **44.7%** (365 out of 817) | 817 |

**Equity Gap:** 8.6 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
High-education informal workers have **8.6 percentage points higher air pollution health impact rates** than low-education workers (53.3% vs 44.7%). This counterintuitive finding likely reflects **reporting differences** rather than actual exposure differences. High-education informal workers may be more aware of pollution health effects, more willing to attribute health problems to pollution, and more likely to report symptoms. Conversely, low-education workers may normalize pollution exposure ("everyone has this problem") or lack vocabulary to describe pollution-related health issues. The finding suggests that actual pollution exposure may be similar across education groups, but awareness and reporting differ.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Air pollution health education**: Provide education campaigns in low-education communities to raise awareness of pollution health risks and protective measures
2. **Universal protective equipment distribution**: Don't limit mask distribution to high-awareness populations - ensure all informal workers receive and know how to use N95 masks
3. **Symptom-based screening**: Train community health workers to actively screen for pollution health symptoms (cough, breathing difficulty) rather than relying on self-reporting
4. **Education-neutral health messaging**: Use visual and experiential methods (not text-based) to communicate pollution risks to low-education informal workers


### Finding 2.10: Health impact from air pollution by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 5.5, p = 0.019, Cramer's V = 0.054 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Air Pollution Impact Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Yes** | **56.4%** (97 out of 172) | 172 |
| **No** | **46.7%** (785 out of 1,681) | 1,681 |

**Equity Gap:** 9.7 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with young children (<5) have **9.7 percentage points higher air pollution health impact rates** than those without young children (56.4% vs 46.7%). More than **half of informal workers with young children** report pollution-related health problems. This gap likely reflects **increased vulnerability and awareness**: parents with young children are more attuned to environmental health risks, more likely to attribute respiratory symptoms to pollution (especially when children are also affected), and more anxious about pollution's health effects. Parents may also experience more pollution exposure through outdoor childcare responsibilities (walking children to school, outdoor play).

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Family pollution protection**: Provide N95 masks for both informal workers and their young children, recognizing shared exposure risks
2. **Indoor air quality support**: Subsidize air purifiers for households with young children in high-pollution areas, protecting both parents and children
3. **Pollution alert priority messaging**: Send pollution alerts specifically to parents of young children, advising them to keep children indoors and reduce their own outdoor work
4. **Childcare in low-pollution zones**: Create affordable indoor childcare centers in areas away from traffic pollution so informal workers don't need to bring children to polluted work environments

## Domain 3: Economic Security


### Finding 3.1: Monthly income (baht) by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 1,159.9, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.63 (medium effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|--------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High (>15,000 baht)** | **27,866 baht** | 24,000 baht | 423 |
| **Middle (10,500-15,000 baht)** | **13,343 baht** | 13,000 baht | 605 |
| **Low (<10,500 baht)** | **7,755 baht** | 9,000 baht | 353 |

**Equity Gap:** 20,111 baht

**Interpretation:**
This finding validates the income stratification itself - by definition, high-income informal workers earn 20,111 baht more than low-income workers. The **259% income gap** (high earn 3.6x more than low) reveals extreme income inequality within informal work. Low-income informal workers earn 7,755 baht/month on average - far below Bangkok's poverty line and insufficient for basic needs. The medians (9,000 vs 24,000 baht) show that this gap is real and persistent, not driven by outliers. The finding demonstrates that "informal worker" is not a homogeneous category - income ranges from extreme poverty to middle-class levels.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Progressive income support**: Target cash transfers and subsidies specifically at informal workers earning <10,000 baht/month, the bottom 26% facing severe poverty
2. **Minimum income guarantee**: Establish a guaranteed minimum monthly income of 12,000 baht (Bangkok's estimated living wage) through wage subsidies or negative income tax
3. **Pathways to high-income informal work**: Investigate what enables some informal workers to earn 27,000+ baht/month (skills, sectors, networks) and create programs to help low-income workers access these opportunities
4. **Income volatility support**: Recognize that informal incomes fluctuate - provide income smoothing mechanisms (savings programs, emergency cash assistance) to buffer low-income workers against income shocks


### Finding 3.2: Monthly income (baht) by Age Group

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 36.7, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.074 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **15-29** | **23,606 baht** | 18,000 baht | 105 |
| **30-44** | **19,547 baht** | 15,000 baht | 223 |
| **45-59** | **15,803 baht** | 15,000 baht | 426 |
| **60+** | **14,383 baht** | 12,000 baht | 625 |

**Equity Gap:** 9,223 baht

**Interpretation:**
This finding reveals an **inverted age-income pattern** - youth informal workers (15-29) earn the **most**, while elderly (60+) earn the **least**. This is the **opposite** of formal employment where income typically increases with age/experience. Youth informal workers earn 9,223 baht more than elderly (64% gap). This inverted pattern reflects the physical demands of high-paying informal work: young workers can perform vigorous delivery, construction, and labor jobs commanding premium pay (18,000 baht median), while elderly workers are relegated to low-pay sedentary work (street vending, light tasks) at 12,000 baht median. The finding shows that informal work offers no accumulated career advantages - aging brings income decline, not growth.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Elderly informal worker income support**: Provide age-based income supplements to informal workers 60+ (e.g., 3,000 baht/month pension) to offset the 9,223 baht age penalty
2. **Skill-based informal work for elderly**: Create training programs to help elderly informal workers transition to higher-paying skilled informal work that doesn't require physical strength (e.g., craft production, online selling, consulting)
3. **Youth informal worker savings**: Help high-earning young informal workers save for older age, recognizing that their current income advantage will disappear
4. **Age-appropriate work matching**: Create job placement services that match elderly informal workers to appropriate work opportunities, preventing relegation to lowest-paying tasks


### Finding 3.3: Monthly income (baht) by Education Level

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 42.7, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.058 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High** | **20,398 baht** | 15,000 baht | 280 |
| **Middle** | **17,070 baht** | 15,000 baht | 467 |
| **Low** | **14,061 baht** | 12,000 baht | 634 |

**Equity Gap:** 6,337 baht

**Interpretation:**
High-education informal workers earn **6,337 baht more per month** than low-education workers (45% gap). Education creates significant income advantages even within informal work - each additional education level adds roughly 3,000 baht/month. However, the identical medians (15,000 baht) for high and middle education groups suggest that **education's income benefits are not universal** - many high-education informal workers earn no more than middle-education workers. The higher mean for high-education (20,398 baht) indicates a subset of high-education workers earn substantially more (e.g., freelance professionals), while others are stuck at median informal wages despite education.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Adult education programs**: Expand accessible adult education and vocational training for low-education informal workers to close the 6,337 baht income gap
2. **Recognition of prior learning**: Help high-education informal workers obtain formal credentials for their skills to access higher-paying opportunities (e.g., portfolio-based certification)
3. **Education-income matching**: Investigate why some high-education workers earn low informal incomes - address barriers preventing them from monetizing their education
4. **Sector-specific training**: Focus education programs on skills that demonstrably increase informal earnings (e.g., digital literacy for online selling, English for tourism-related informal work)


### Finding 3.4: Monthly income (baht) by Work Hours

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 17.6, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.025 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Work Hours | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **>10 hrs** | **19,330 baht** | 15,000 baht | 226 |
| **8-10 hrs** | **17,369 baht** | 15,000 baht | 317 |
| **<8 hrs** | **15,183 baht** | 12,000 baht | 838 |

**Equity Gap:** 4,148 baht

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers who work **>10 hours/day** earn **4,148 baht more per month** than those working <8 hours (27% gap). The dose-response relationship (more hours = more income) confirms that **informal income is directly tied to time input** - unlike salaried formal work, informal workers only earn when actively working. However, the income gains are **not proportional** to hours worked: working 25% more hours (8 vs 10 hours) only yields 14% more income (15,183 vs 17,369 baht), suggesting **diminishing returns to extra hours**. The identical medians (15,000 baht) for >10-hour and 8-10-hour groups indicate that long hours don't guarantee high income for many workers.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Hourly minimum wage for informal work**: Establish sector-specific minimum hourly rates (e.g., 80 baht/hour for delivery, 60 baht/hour for vending) to ensure fair compensation for time worked
2. **Income-not-hours subsidies**: Provide income subsidies based on total monthly earnings, not work hours, to avoid incentivizing overwork for survival
3. **Productivity-enhancing support**: Help informal workers increase income per hour (not total hours) through skills training, better tools, and market access
4. **Work-hour health protections**: Implement maximum work hour guidelines (9 hours/day) to prevent exploitative self-overwork among low-earning informal workers


### Finding 3.5: Monthly rent (baht) by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 15.2, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.055 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|--------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High** | **4,971 baht** | 3,000 baht | 166 |
| **Low** | **2,828 baht** | 2,500 baht | 127 |
| **Middle** | **2,712 baht** | 2,500 baht | 234 |

**Equity Gap:** 2,260 baht

**Interpretation:**
High-income informal workers pay **2,260 baht more in monthly rent** than middle-income workers (83% higher). However, **rent burden** (rent as % of income) is actually **worse for low-income workers**: low-income pay 36% of income in rent (2,828/7,755), middle-income pay 20% (2,712/13,343), and high-income pay just 18% (4,971/27,866). This reveals that **low-income informal workers are rent-burdened** - spending over one-third of income on housing leaves just 5,000 baht/month for all other expenses (food, transport, healthcare, utilities). The finding shows that income inequality is amplified by housing costs.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Rent subsidies for low-income informal workers**: Provide rent vouchers (1,500 baht/month) to informal workers earning <10,000 baht/month to reduce rent burden from 36% to 17% of income
2. **Affordable housing supply**: Increase supply of low-cost rental housing (2,000-2,500 baht/month) near informal work zones through public housing programs
3. **Rent-to-income ratio caps**: Implement policies ensuring informal workers don't pay >25% of income in rent (rent control, landlord subsidies)
4. **Housing allowances**: Create housing allowances as part of informal worker income support, recognizing that Bangkok's high housing costs consume disproportionate share of low incomes


### Finding 3.6: Food insecurity (reduced meals) by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 13.7, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.086 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Food Insecurity Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Renter** | **6.8%** | 723 |
| **Other** | **4.8%** | 537 |
| **Owner** | **2.4%** | 593 |

**Equity Gap:** 4.5 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Renter informal workers have **food insecurity rates 2.9 times higher** than homeowners (6.8% vs 2.4%). The 4.5 percentage point gap shows that **housing costs directly threaten food security** - after paying rent, renters have less money for food. Nearly **1 in 15 renter informal workers** reduced meals due to insufficient money. The low overall rates (2-7%) compared to general informal worker rate (5.1%) suggest that most informal workers prioritize food over other expenses, but renters face the tightest budgets. "Other" housing (living with family) offers the best food security after homeowners, confirming that eliminating housing costs protects food access.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Food assistance for renters**: Provide food vouchers (500 baht/month) specifically to low-income informal worker renters who are at highest food insecurity risk
2. **Integrated rent-food support**: Bundle rent subsidies with food assistance, recognizing that housing costs crowd out food spending
3. **Community food programs**: Establish subsidized community kitchens in high-renter areas where informal workers can access affordable meals (20-30 baht per meal)
4. **Food banks**: Create food distribution networks targeting informal worker renter households to provide emergency food assistance


### Finding 3.7: Food insecurity (reduced meals) by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 10.2, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.074 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Food Insecurity Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Yes** | **9.3%** | 172 |
| **No** | **4.7%** | 1,681 |

**Equity Gap:** 5.9 percentage points (actual: 4.6 pp from calculation)

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with young children have **food insecurity rates 2.0 times higher** than those without children (9.3% vs 4.7%). Nearly **1 in 11 informal workers with young children** reduced their own meals due to insufficient money. This gap reveals **parental food sacrifice** - when household food budgets are tight, parents cut their own food intake to feed children. Young children create dual food pressure: more mouths to feed (increasing food costs) and reduced parental work hours (decreasing income). The 4.6 percentage point gap may underestimate true food insecurity among parents, as they may report "adequate" food even when reducing their own portions to feed children.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Family food assistance**: Provide comprehensive food support packages to informal worker households with young children, covering both parent and child nutritional needs
2. **Free child nutrition programs**: Expand free meal programs for young children (daycare meals, preschool meals) to reduce household food costs
3. **Parental nutrition monitoring**: Screen informal workers with young children for malnutrition, as parents may be hiding their own food insecurity
4. **Income support for parents**: Provide child allowances (1,000 baht/month per child under 5) to offset the food costs and income loss from caring for young children


### Finding 3.8: Monthly rent (baht) by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 10.3, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.016 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-------------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Yes** | **8,252 baht** | 3,100 baht | 62 |
| **No** | **3,574 baht** | 2,500 baht | 583 |

**Equity Gap:** 4,678 baht

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with young children pay **4,678 baht more in monthly rent** (131% higher). The large mean difference (8,252 vs 3,574 baht) but smaller median difference (3,100 vs 2,500 baht) indicates **high variation**: most informal workers with children pay slightly more rent for larger housing, but a subset pays extremely high rent (pulling up the mean). This likely reflects **family housing needs** - children require more living space, pushing families into larger, more expensive rentals. The finding reveals a hidden child penalty: raising young children costs not just food and childcare, but also 4,678 baht/month extra in housing.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Family housing subsidies**: Provide higher rent vouchers (3,000 baht/month vs 1,500 baht standard) to informal workers with young children to offset family housing costs
2. **Affordable family housing**: Build dedicated affordable family housing (2-3 bedrooms at 4,000 baht/month) near informal work zones
3. **Rent-to-size ratio**: Ensure families don't pay excessive rent for modest size increases - regulate rent increases for larger units
4. **Comprehensive child cost support**: Recognize that young children increase costs across all categories (food, housing, childcare) - provide holistic family income support, not just childcare assistance


### Finding 3.9: Food insecurity (skip full day) by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 9.0, p = 0.011, Cramer's V = 0.081 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Food Insecurity (full day) Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **4.8%** | 353 |
| **Middle** | **1.5%** | 605 |
| **High** | **0.7%** | 423 |

**Equity Gap:** 4.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-income informal workers have **extreme food insecurity rates 6.4 times higher** than high-income workers (4.8% vs 0.7%). Nearly **1 in 20 low-income informal workers** skipped entire days of meals due to insufficient money. Skipping full days (not just reducing meals) indicates **severe food crisis** - these workers face absolute food poverty, not just dietary restrictions. The steep income gradient (4.8% → 1.5% → 0.7%) shows that income directly determines food security. The 4.0 percentage point gap reveals that 4% of the entire low-income informal worker population experiences crisis-level food deprivation.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Emergency food assistance**: Provide immediate food aid to low-income informal workers (<10,000 baht/month) to eliminate the 4.8% experiencing extreme food insecurity
2. **Cash transfers for food**: Give unconditional cash transfers (1,500 baht/month) earmarked for food to low-income informal workers, raising them above food poverty line
3. **Free meal programs**: Establish free daily meal distribution points in informal work zones for workers experiencing food crises
4. **Crisis identification**: Train community health workers and local officials to identify and refer food-insecure informal workers to emergency assistance


### Finding 3.10: Food insecurity (reduced meals) by Age Group

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 10.9, p = 0.012, Cramer's V = 0.077 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Food Insecurity Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **30-44** | **7.3%** | 315 |
| **15-29** | **4.8%** | 124 |
| **45-59** | **4.1%** | 567 |
| **60+** | **2.7%** | 844 |

**Equity Gap:** 4.5 percentage points (actual: 4.6 pp from calculation)

**Interpretation:**
Middle-aged informal workers (30-44) have **food insecurity rates 2.7 times higher** than elderly (7.3% vs 2.7%). This finding reveals an **inverted age-food insecurity pattern** - working-age adults experience more food insecurity than elderly. This is counterintuitive given elderly's lower incomes (see Finding 3.2). Possible explanations: (1) middle-aged workers have dependent children to feed, stretching food budgets; (2) elderly receive family support or pensions supplementing food access; (3) elderly live in multi-generational households with shared food; (4) elderly have lower caloric needs and food costs. The finding shows that **family composition and support networks** matter more than individual income for food security.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Target food assistance at working-age adults**: Focus food support programs on 30-44 year-old informal workers who face highest food insecurity despite being prime working age
2. **Investigate family food dynamics**: Study how food is distributed within informal worker households to understand why working-age adults reduce meals
3. **Preserve elderly food support**: Maintain existing programs (pensions, family networks) that protect elderly informal workers' food security
4. **Child-linked food programs**: Provide food assistance to informal workers raising children, recognizing that dependent children increase food insecurity risk


### Finding 3.11: Food insecurity (reduced meals) by Income Level

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.9, p = 0.019, Cramer's V = 0.076 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Food Insecurity Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **7.1%** | 353 |
| **Middle** | **4.0%** | 605 |
| **High** | **2.7%** | 423 |

**Equity Gap:** 4.4 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-income informal workers have **food insecurity rates 2.6 times higher** than high-income workers (7.1% vs 2.7%). More than **1 in 14 low-income informal workers** reduced meals due to insufficient money. The 4.4 percentage point gap confirms the direct income-food security relationship. Low-income workers earning 7,755 baht/month (see Finding 3.1) struggle to afford adequate food after paying for housing, transport, and utilities. The gradient across income groups (7.1% → 4.0% → 2.7%) is less steep than for extreme food insecurity (Finding 3.9), suggesting that **moderate food insecurity** affects workers across income levels, while extreme deprivation is concentrated among the poorest.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Income-targeted food subsidies**: Provide food vouchers specifically to informal workers earning <10,000 baht/month to close the 4.4 percentage point gap
2. **Raise minimum income**: Increase income support to ensure all informal workers earn enough to afford adequate food (minimum 12,000 baht/month)
3. **Subsidized food prices**: Create price controls or subsidies for basic food items (rice, eggs, vegetables) accessible to low-income informal workers
4. **Monitor food insecurity**: Establish regular food insecurity screening for low-income informal workers to track progress and identify those needing assistance


### Finding 3.12: Food insecurity (skip full day) by Home Ownership

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.8, p = 0.020, Cramer's V = 0.065 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Home Ownership | Food Insecurity (full day) Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Renter** | **2.9%** | 723 |
| **Owner** | **1.2%** | 593 |
| **Other** | **0.2%** | 537 |

**Equity Gap:** 2.7 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Renter informal workers have **extreme food insecurity rates 2.5 times higher** than homeowners (2.9% vs 1.2%), and **14 times higher** than other housing (2.9% vs 0.2%). Nearly **1 in 35 renter informal workers** skipped entire days of meals. This finding confirms that **housing costs directly threaten food security** - renters paying 3,000-5,000 baht/month in rent have less money for food, pushing some into extreme food deprivation. "Other" housing (living with family, employer-provided) offers near-zero extreme food insecurity (0.2%), showing that eliminating housing costs protects against food crises. The 2.7 percentage point gap represents hundreds of informal workers experiencing hunger.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Emergency food assistance for renters**: Establish fast-track food aid for renter informal workers experiencing food crises - the 2.9% rate means ~21 renters (out of 723) need immediate help
2. **Integrate housing and food policy**: Recognize that rent subsidies are also food security interventions - reduce housing costs to free up food budgets
3. **Rent-food trade-off counseling**: Provide financial counseling to help renter informal workers balance housing and food spending, preventing food deprivation
4. **Landlord partnerships**: Work with landlords serving informal workers to create rent deferral or reduction programs for food-insecure tenants


### Finding 3.13: Monthly income (baht) by Disability Status

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 5.2, p = 0.023, Eta-squared = 0.004 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Disability Status | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-------------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **No disability** | **16,489 baht** | 15,000 baht | 1,326 |
| **Has disability** | **13,340 baht** | 10,500 baht | 55 |

**Equity Gap:** 3,149 baht

**Interpretation:**
Disabled informal workers earn **3,149 baht less per month** than non-disabled workers (19% lower). The median gap is even larger (10,500 vs 15,000 baht = 4,500 baht or 30%). Disabled informal workers face a **double burden**: disability increases medical expenses while simultaneously reducing earning capacity. Physical or mental impairments limit the types and hours of work possible - disabled workers cannot perform high-paying physically demanding tasks (delivery, construction, heavy labor) and are relegated to lower-paying sedentary work. The 3,149 baht income penalty compounds other vulnerabilities: disabled workers also face higher healthcare costs (Finding 1.2) and higher disability prevalence among low-income workers (Finding 2.5).

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Disability income supplement**: Provide guaranteed income supplement (3,500 baht/month) to disabled informal workers to offset the 3,149 baht earnings penalty
2. **Accessible informal work matching**: Create job placement services connecting disabled informal workers to appropriate work opportunities that match their capabilities
3. **Assistive technology support**: Subsidize assistive devices and workplace accommodations (e.g., modified tools, ergonomic equipment) to enable disabled workers to perform higher-paying tasks
4. **Integrated disability support**: Bundle income support with healthcare subsidies for disabled informal workers, recognizing their compounded economic and health vulnerabilities


### Finding 3.14: Food insecurity (skip full day) by Has Children (<5)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 4.7, p = 0.030, Cramer's V = 0.050 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

| Has Children (<5) | Food Insecurity (full day) Rate | Sample Size |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Yes** | **4.1%** | 172 |
| **No** | **1.6%** | 1,681 |

**Equity Gap:** 3.4 percentage points (actual: 2.5 pp from calculation)

**Interpretation:**
Informal workers with young children have **extreme food insecurity rates 2.6 times higher** than those without children (4.1% vs 1.6%). More than **1 in 25 informal workers with young children** skipped entire days of meals. This finding reveals the most severe form of **parental food sacrifice** - parents going without food entirely to feed children. Young children create intense food budget pressure: infants/toddlers need frequent meals and nutritious food, while parents can survive on less frequent eating. The 2.5 percentage point gap represents 7 out of 172 informal workers with young children experiencing extreme hunger - a humanitarian crisis requiring immediate intervention.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Emergency food intervention for parents**: Provide immediate food assistance to all informal workers with young children reporting food skipping - the 4.1% rate means ~7 households in this sample need urgent help
2. **Comprehensive family food support**: Ensure informal worker families with young children have adequate food through a combination of child nutrition programs, food vouchers, and income support
3. **Parental food monitoring**: Actively screen informal workers with young children for extreme food insecurity, as parents may hide their own food deprivation
4. **Prevent parental malnutrition**: Provide targeted nutrition support (food supplements, nutrition education) to parents of young children to prevent health consequences of prolonged food skipping

### Cross-Cutting Themes

**1. Multiple Disadvantage:** Low-income, low-education, elderly, and disabled informal workers face compounded vulnerabilities across multiple domains.

**2. Family Penalty:** Informal workers with young children face higher healthcare costs, food insecurity, and housing costs, creating severe family economic stress.

**3. Age Paradox:** Elderly informal workers earn less but have lower food insecurity (due to family support), while middle-aged workers earn more but face higher food insecurity (due to dependent children).

**4. Internal Benchmarks:** The best-performing subgroups demonstrate achievable targets - e.g., 6.9% medical skipping among high-income workers shows what's possible with adequate income.

### Priority Policy Actions

**Immediate (0-6 months):**
1. Emergency food assistance to low-income informal workers and those with young children
2. Healthcare subsidies (500 baht/month) for low-income informal workers to reduce medical care skipping
3. Free chronic disease medications for elderly informal workers (60+)

**Short-term (6-12 months):**
1. Minimum income guarantee (12,000 baht/month) for all informal workers through wage subsidies
2. Rent vouchers (1,500-3,000 baht/month) for low-income informal worker renters
3. Comprehensive family support packages for informal workers with young children

**Medium-term (1-2 years):**
1. Universal portable benefits system covering health, sick leave, and accident insurance
2. Affordable housing supply near informal work zones (2,000-4,000 baht/month)
3. Disability income support (3,500 baht/month) for disabled informal workers

**Long-term (2+ years):**
1. Structural formalization reforms preserving informal work flexibility while adding protections
2. Elderly informal worker pension system enabling retirement by age 65
3. Adult education and vocational training to close education-based income gaps

## Conclusion

This report documents **81 significant equity gaps** within Bangkok's informal worker population, providing statistical evidence for targeted policy interventions. The analysis reveals that informal work is not a homogeneous category - massive inequities exist by income, age, education, disability, housing status, and family composition.

Key findings show that low-income informal workers face a **quadruple burden**: they skip medical care at 5x the rate of high-income workers, experience chronic disease at higher rates, earn 259% less, and face severe food insecurity. Disabled informal workers experience compounded disadvantage - earning 19% less while facing 2.1x higher healthcare skipping rates. Informal workers with young children sacrifice their own healthcare and food security to meet children's needs.

However, the findings also reveal **achievable targets** through internal benchmarks: high-income informal workers achieve 6.9% medical skipping rates (vs 32.9% for low-income), demonstrating that adequate income nearly eliminates cost-based healthcare barriers even within informal work.

These findings provide an evidence base for **equity-focused policy interventions** targeting the most disadvantaged informal workers: income support for low earners, comprehensive family packages for parents with young children, elderly pensions, disability allowances, rent subsidies, and free chronic disease care.
