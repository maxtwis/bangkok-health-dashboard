# Informal Worker Equity Report: Bangkok Health Survey

**Sample:** 1,853 informal workers from Bangkok
**Method:** Part 1 - Comparison with formal workers | Part 2 - Descriptive stratified analysis with statistical testing
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## Executive Summary

This report examines **equity among informal workers** through two analyses:
1. **Part 1 (Context):** How informal workers compare to formal workers
2. **Part 2 (Main Focus):** Hidden inequities WITHIN informal workers

**Informal workers** are defined as those with occupation_type=6 (freelance/independent work: street vendors, delivery riders, construction workers, domestic workers, online sellers).

### Part 1: Informal vs Formal Workers - Key Gaps

| Metric | Informal Workers | Formal Workers | Gap |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-----|
| Monthly income (baht) | 16,363 | 28,670 | -12,306 (-43%) |
| Has employment contract | 4.2% | 84.9% | -80.7 pp |
| Has work benefits | 3.8% | 87.9% | -84.1 pp |
| Work injury (serious, past 12 months) | 5.6% | 8.0% | -2.4 pp |
| Work injury (minor, past 12 months) | 14.4% | 14.3% | +0.1 pp |
| Skip medical care due to cost | 13.3% | 18.7% | -5.4 pp |
| Food insecurity (reduced meals) | 5.1% | 13.6% | -8.6 pp |
| Working hours per day | 8 | 9 | -1 (-8%) |


**Key insight:** Informal workers earn 43% less and have virtually zero legal protections (contracts, benefits). However, they have LOWER healthcare and food insecurity than formal workers (surprising finding - likely due to age differences and household support).

2. **Monthly income (baht)** by Age Group: 9223.3 baht/month

9. **Personal health expenses (baht/month)** by Home Ownership: 154.7 baht/month
