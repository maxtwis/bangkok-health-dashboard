# Social Determinants of Health Equity (SDHE) Analysis
## Population Group Health Equity Gaps - Bangkok Health Dashboard

### Overview
This document analyzes health equity gaps between population groups using Social Determinants of Health Equity indicators from the Bangkok Health Dashboard survey dataset (**6,523 responses** across 50 Bangkok districts). The analysis uses a matrix format with population groups as rows and SDHE indicators as columns to identify disparities and guide targeted interventions.
