# Elderly Occupation Analysis - CORRECTED
## With Proper Income Conversion (Daily Income × 30)

**Bangkok Health Equity Survey - Elderly Population (Age 60+)**
**Sample**: n=2,986 elderly respondents
**Average Age**: 72.4 years
**Date**: 2025-11-17
**CORRECTION**: Daily income multiplied by 30 to get monthly income

---

## CRITICAL CORRECTION

**Previous Analysis ERROR**: Did not convert daily income to monthly
- ❌ Reported informal workers earning 2,601 baht/month
- ❌ Reported formal workers earning 5.9× more than informal

**Corrected Analysis**: Daily income × 30
- ✅ Informal workers earn 14,388 baht/month (not 2,601!)
- ✅ Formal workers earn 1.32× more than informal (not 5.9×!)

The income gap is MUCH SMALLER than initially reported.

## 1. Employment Status (UNCHANGED - Disease Data)

| Employment Status | Count | Percentage | Chronic Disease |
|------------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Currently employed** | 1,147 | **38.4%** | **71.1%** |
| **Not employed** | 1,839 | **61.6%** | **83.5%** |
| **Gap** | — | — | **-12.5pp** |
| **p-value** | — | — | **p<0.000001 ✅** |

**This finding remains UNCHANGED**: Employed elderly have 12.5pp less chronic disease (p<0.000001).

## 2. Occupation Types - CORRECTED Income

### Income by Occupation Type (Corrected)

| Occupation Type | Count | % of Employed | **Monthly Income (CORRECTED)** | Disease Rate |
|----------------|-------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Government** | 7 | 0.6% | **24,400 baht** | 57.1% |
| **State enterprise** | 4 | 0.3% | **21,500 baht** | 25.0% |
| **Company employee** | 98 | 8.5% | **18,435 baht** | 66.3% |
| **Own business** | 97 | 8.5% | **16,482 baht** | 70.1% |
| **Informal/freelance** | **845** | **73.7%** | **14,388 baht** | 71.7% |
| **Other** | 95 | 8.3% | **11,974 baht** | 73.7% |

**Key Finding**: 73.7% of employed elderly are informal workers (this remains unchanged).

## 3. Formal vs Informal - CORRECTED Gap

### CORRECTED Comparison

| Worker Type | Monthly Income | Sample | Disease |
|------------|---------------|--------|---------|
| **Formal** (gov + state + company) | **18,948 baht** | n=76 | 64.2% |
| **Informal** (freelance) | **14,388 baht** | n=626 | 71.7% |
| **Gap** | **+4,560 baht** | — | -7.5pp |
| **Multiplier** | **1.32× (NOT 5.9×!)** | — | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.000059 ✅** | — | p=0.1053 (NS) |

---

### OLD vs NEW Comparison

| Measure | ❌ INCORRECT (Before) | ✅ CORRECTED (After) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Formal income | 15,444 baht | **18,948 baht** |
| Informal income | 2,601 baht | **14,388 baht** |
| Gap | 12,843 baht | **4,560 baht** |
| Multiplier | 5.9× | **1.32×** |
| p-value | p<0.000001 | p=0.000059 (still significant) |

**Interpretation**:
- The income gap is STILL statistically significant (p=0.000059)
- But the MAGNITUDE is much smaller: 1.32× instead of 5.9×
- Informal workers earn 14,388 baht, which is actually quite reasonable, not poverty-level 2,601

## 4. Income Hierarchy - CORRECTED

| Occupation | Monthly Income | Multiplier vs Informal |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Government | 24,400 baht | 1.70× |
| State enterprise | 21,500 baht | 1.49× |
| Company employee | 18,435 baht | 1.28× |
| Own business | 16,482 baht | 1.15× |
| **Informal/freelance** | **14,388 baht** | **(baseline)** |
| Other | 11,974 baht | 0.83× |

**Key Finding**: The income hierarchy is much FLATTER than previously reported. Government workers only earn 1.70× informal workers (not 9.4×!).

---

## 5. Revised Interpretation

### What Changed

**OLD Interpretation** (WRONG):
- "Informal workers in extreme poverty earning 2,601 baht"
- "Formal workers earn 5.9× more - massive inequality"
- "One of the largest income gaps in the entire study"

**NEW Interpretation** (CORRECT):
- Informal workers earn 14,388 baht - reasonable income for age 72.4
- Formal workers earn 1.32× more - modest gap
- Income gap is significant (p=0.000059) but not extreme

---

### What Remains TRUE

✅ **38.4% of elderly still work at age 72.4** - unchanged
✅ **73.7% of employed are informal workers** - unchanged
✅ **Employed have 12.5pp less disease** (p<0.000001) - unchanged
✅ **Formal workers earn MORE than informal** (p=0.000059) - still significant
✅ **Disease gap NOT significant** (p=0.1053) - unchanged

---

### What is DIFFERENT

❌ **Income gap is 1.32× (not 5.9×)** - much smaller
❌ **Informal earn 14,388 baht (not 2,601)** - not poverty-level
❌ **Gap is 4,560 baht (not 12,843)** - modest difference
❌ **NOT one of the largest gaps** - actually quite moderate

## 6. Corrected Summary for SDHE Report

### Pathway 1: Current Occupation Status (CORRECTED)

**Employment Status (38.4% still working at age 72.4)**:

| Status | Chronic Disease | Sample |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Employed | 71.1% | n=1,147 (38.4%) |
| Unemployed | 83.5% | n=1,839 (61.6%) |
| **Gap** | **-12.5pp** | — |
| **p-value** | **p<0.000001 ✅** | — |

**Among Employed - Occupation Types (CORRECTED INCOME)**:

| Occupation Type | % of Employed | Monthly Income |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Government | 0.6% | 24,400 baht |
| State enterprise | 0.3% | 21,500 baht |
| Company employee | 8.5% | 18,435 baht |
| Own business | 8.5% | 16,482 baht |
| **Informal/freelance** | **73.7%** | **14,388 baht** |
| Other | 8.3% | 11,974 baht |

**Formal vs Informal Workers (CORRECTED)**:

| Type | Monthly Income | Sample |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Formal | 18,948 baht | n=76 |
| Informal | 14,388 baht | n=626 |
| **Gap** | **+4,560 baht (1.32×)** | — |
| **p-value** | **p=0.000059 ✅** | — |

**Explanation**: 38.4% of elderly still work at age 72.4. Employed elderly have 12.5pp LESS chronic disease (p<0.000001). 73.7% work in informal sector earning 14,388 baht/month. Formal workers earn 1.32× more (18,948 baht, p=0.000059) - a modest but statistically significant gap. Temporal direction unclear (health enables work vs work improves health). Mechanisms unknown.

## 7. Key Statistical Notes

1. **Income conversion**: Daily income × 30 to get monthly income
2. **income_type variable**: 1 = daily, 2 = monthly
3. **Sample sizes**:
   - Formal workers: n=76 (small sample)
   - Informal workers: n=626 (large sample)
4. **Significance maintained**: Gap still significant (p=0.000059) despite being smaller
5. **Temporal direction**: Unclear if health enables work or work improves health

## 8. Comparison: What Was Wrong

| Metric | ❌ Before (Wrong) | ✅ After (Corrected) | Change |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Informal income | 2,601 baht | 14,388 baht | +11,787 baht |
| Formal income | 15,444 baht | 18,948 baht | +3,504 baht |
| Gap | 12,843 baht | 4,560 baht | -8,283 baht |
| Multiplier | 5.9× | 1.32× | -4.58× |
| Interpretation | "Extreme poverty" | "Reasonable income" | Major change |

---

**LESSON LEARNED**: Always check if income is daily or monthly and convert appropriately. The difference between 2,601 and 14,388 baht completely changes the interpretation from "extreme inequality" to "modest but significant gap".
