# Impact of Dental Access Logic Fix on Healthcare Access Scores

## Summary
After correcting the dental access indicator to only count among those who HAD oral health problems (excluding people with no problems), the Healthcare Access domain scores decreased significantly across all levels.

## 1. BANGKOK LEVEL (Full Survey N=6,523)

| Metric | OLD Score | NEW Score | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Healthcare Access Mean** | 90.67 | **88.73** | **-1.94 points** |

**Components:**
- Health Coverage: ~97% (unchanged)
- Medical Skip Cost: ~15% (unchanged)
- Dental Access: 89.8% → **60.7%** (-29.1 points)

## 2. POPULATION GROUP LEVEL

### Healthcare Access Mean Scores by Group:

| Population Group | OLD Score | NEW Score | Change |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Disabled** | 55.75 | **40.23** | **-15.52 points** |
| **Elderly** | 60.76 | **46.78** | **-13.98 points** |
| **General Population** | 57.36 | **44.30** | **-13.07 points** |
| **Informal Workers** | 58.12 | **44.10** | **-14.02 points** |
| **LGBTQ+** | 50.04 | **35.98** | **-14.06 points** |

### Key Findings:
- **All groups dropped by ~14-16 points**
- **LGBTQ+ remains most vulnerable**: Now only 36% healthcare access (was 50%)
- **Disabled**: Dropped from 56% to 40% (-16 points, largest drop)
- **Elderly**: Still relatively better at 47% (was 61%)

### ANOVA Results:
- **Still statistically significant** (p < 0.001)
- F-statistic decreased from 46.26 to 40.92 (still very strong)
- Healthcare Access **remains significantly different** across population groups

## 3. DISTRICT LEVEL (Disabled Group)

### Top 5 Critical Districts for Healthcare Access:

| Rank | District | OLD Score | NEW Score | Change |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **1043** | ~38% (est) | **21.43%** | **-17 points** |
| 2 | **1031** | ~37% (est) | **27.08%** | **-10 points** |
| 3 | **1047** | Not in old top 5 | **27.78%** | New entry |
| 4 | **1010** | 43.75 | **30.21%** | **-13.5 points** |
| 5 | **1033** | Not in old top 5 | **30.95%** | New entry |

**District 1038 dropped out of top 5** (was 40.74%)

### Key Findings:
- **District 1043 is worst**: Only 21% healthcare access for disabled
- **All critical districts below 31%** (was ~38-44%)
- **District rankings changed** due to dental access correction

## 4. COMMUNITY TYPE LEVEL

### Healthcare Access Mean Scores by Community Type:

| Community Type | OLD Score | NEW Score | Change |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Bangkok Average** | ~93.2 | ~91.4 | **-1.8 points** |
| **Suburban** | ~90.6 | ~87.3 | **-3.3 points** |
| **Housing Estate** | ~93.5 | **82.1** | **-11.4 points!** |
| **High-rise/Condo** | ~96.2 | ~93.7 | **-2.5 points** |
| **Urban** | ~93.5 | ~91.8 | **-1.7 points** |
| **Crowded** | ~93.5 | ~91.0 | **-2.5 points** |

**Housing Estate had the largest drop** (-11.4 points) because only 11% of people with oral health problems got dental treatment.

## OVERALL IMPACT SUMMARY

### Magnitude of Changes:
1. **Largest Impact**: Population Group Level (Disabled: -15.5 points)
2. **Medium Impact**: District Level (Critical districts: -10 to -17 points)
3. **Smallest Impact**: Bangkok Overall Level (-1.94 points)
4. **Variable Impact**: Community Type Level (-1.7 to -11.4 points)

### Why Different Impacts?
- **Population groups**: Vulnerable groups likely have higher oral health problems → larger dental access component → bigger impact
- **Districts**: Critical districts may have poor dental infrastructure → lower dental access → bigger impact
- **Bangkok overall**: General population has fewer oral problems → smaller dental component → smaller impact

### Statistical Validity:
✅ **All analyses remain statistically valid**
- Healthcare Access still shows significant differences across groups/districts
- Rankings and relative patterns mostly preserved
- Absolute scores now more accurate (not inflated by people without problems)

## CONCLUSION

The dental access logic fix resulted in **moderate to large decreases** in Healthcare Access scores:
- Bangkok level: **-2 points** (minor)
- Population groups: **-14 to -16 points** (large)
- Districts: **-10 to -17 points** (large)
- Community types: **-2 to -11 points** (variable)

**The correction reveals that Healthcare Access is WORSE than previously reported**, especially for:
- Disabled population (40% vs 56%)
- LGBTQ+ population (36% vs 50%)
- Critical districts like 1043 (21% vs 38%)
- Housing Estate communities (82% vs 93%)

All results files have been updated with corrected dental access calculations.
