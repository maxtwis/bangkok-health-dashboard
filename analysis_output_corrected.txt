6. KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

✓ SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS FOUND:
  - Age: Strong positive correlation with chronic disease
  - Income: Negative trend (lower income → higher disease rate)
  - Education: Negative trend (lower education → higher disease rate)
  - Lifestyle factors: Exercise, smoking, and drinking show relationships

📊 RISK PROFILE:
  - Highest risk: Low income + Low education + Older age
  - Lowest risk: High income + High education + Younger age
  - Socioeconomic factors compound with age

🔍 POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
  - Target interventions for low-income, low-education populations
  - Age-specific prevention programs needed
  - Address lifestyle factors across all socioeconomic groups
  - District-level variations suggest localized intervention strategies
