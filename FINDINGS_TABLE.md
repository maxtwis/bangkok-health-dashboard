## Key Statistics for Report Highlights

### Most Impactful Finding
**"53.6% of low-income disabled individuals skip medical care"**
- Population: Disabled, low-income (avg 330 THB/month)
- p=0.017, n=152
- Effect: Over half avoid care despite health needs

### Largest Effect Size (Categorical)
**"35.2 percentage point healthcare access gap by income"**
- Population: Elderly
- Low income: 44.8% skip care (291 THB/month)
- High income: 9.7% skip care (12,478 THB/month)
- p<0.001, n=863

### Largest Effect Size (Continuous)
**"+17,756 THB monthly income from education"**
- Population: Informal workers
- Low education: 2,943 THB/month
- High education: 20,699 THB/month
- p<0.001, n=2,048

### Most Paradoxical Finding
**"High-income informal workers: 16.9% food insecure"**
- Population: Informal workers, high-income (avg 30,983 THB/month)
- vs Low-income: 8.3% food insecure (avg 368 THB/month)
- p<0.001, n=2,048
- Interpretation: Income volatility > income level

### Most Actionable Finding
**"Education → +17,756 THB income gain for informal workers"**

## Narrative Soundbites (Ready for Report)

### On Healthcare Access
> "Among low-income elderly residents earning an average of 291 THB per month, nearly half (44.8%) reported skipping medical care when needed, compared to only 9.7% of high-income elderly—a staggering 35.2 percentage point difference (p<0.001, n=863)."

### On Education Returns
> "Education shows its strongest economic returns among informal workers, where high education is associated with monthly income 17,756 THB higher than low education (p<0.001, n=2,048)—a six-fold income difference."

### On Chronic Disease
> "Chronic disease creates a vicious cycle of reduced physical activity. Among disabled individuals with chronic conditions, only 26.8% exercise regularly compared to 43.0% of those without chronic disease—a 16.2 percentage point reduction (p<0.001, n=638)."

### On Income Volatility
> "Among informal workers, we observed a paradoxical pattern where high-income earners (average 30,983 THB/month) showed the highest food insecurity rate at 16.9%, compared to 8.3% among low-income workers (p<0.001, n=2,048). This counter-intuitive finding suggests that income volatility—not just income level—drives food insecurity."

### On Upstream Interventions
> "Education emerges as a critical upstream determinant with cascading effects across multiple domains. Higher education improves economic security, which subsequently improves healthcare access, creating an education→income→healthcare access pathway that suggests high-leverage intervention opportunities."
