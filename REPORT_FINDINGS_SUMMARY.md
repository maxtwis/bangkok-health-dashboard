# Cross-Domain Findings - Report Integration Summary

## Quick Reference: Statistically Significant Relationships

### 1. CHRONIC DISEASE → EXERCISE BEHAVIOR
**All populations show significant reduction in exercise among those with chronic disease**

| Population | Without Disease | With Disease | Difference | p-value | n |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------|---|
| Elderly | 48.2% | 37.1% | **-11.1pp** | p<0.001 | 2,986 |
| Disabled | 43.0% | 26.8% | **-16.2pp** | p<0.001 | 638 |
| Informal Workers | 50.5% | 40.3% | **-10.2pp** | p<0.001 | 2,645 |

**Report Use:** Demonstrates need for chronic disease management programs that include adapted physical activity components.

### 2. INCOME → HEALTHCARE ACCESS (Medical Care Avoidance)
**Low income dramatically increases likelihood of skipping medical care**

| Population | Low Income | Medium Income | High Income | Difference | p-value | n |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|---------|---|
| Elderly | **44.8%** | 9.6% | 9.7% | **-35.2pp** | p<0.001 | 863 |
| Disabled | **53.6%** | 26.7% | 35.3% | **-18.3pp** | p=0.017 | 152 |
| Informal Workers | **39.4%** | 13.1% | 23.7% | **-26.3pp** | p<0.001 | 2,048 |

**Income Ranges:**
- Elderly: Low=291 THB, Medium=553 THB, High=12,478 THB
- Disabled: Low=330 THB, Medium=8,465 THB, High=34,098 THB
- Informal: Low=368 THB, Medium=4,753 THB, High=30,983 THB

**Report Use:** Strongest evidence for income-based healthcare access barriers. Over half of low-income disabled skip care.

### 3. EDUCATION → HEALTHCARE ACCESS (Medical Care Avoidance)
**Lower education increases medical care avoidance**

| Population | Low Education | Medium Education | High Education | Difference | p-value | n |
|------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------|---------|---|
| Elderly | **17.3%** | 11.9% | 7.2% | **-10.1pp** | p<0.001 | 2,986 |

**Report Use:** Education gradient suggests health literacy interventions could improve healthcare access.

### 4. EDUCATION → INCOME
**Education strongly predicts income across all populations**

| Population | Low Education | Medium Education | High Education | Income Gain | p-value | n |
|------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|---|
| General | 15,357 THB | 25,545 THB | 27,062 THB | **+11,704 THB** | p<0.001 | 1,279 |
| Elderly | 2,797 THB | 7,714 THB | 14,203 THB | **+11,406 THB** | p<0.001 | 863 |
| Informal Workers | 2,943 THB | 14,427 THB | 20,699 THB | **+17,756 THB** | p<0.001 | 2,048 |

**Report Use:** Combined with Education→Contract→Income pathway already documented for elderly. Shows education is key upstream intervention point.

---

### 5. INCOME → FOOD SECURITY
**Complex relationship with paradoxical high-income insecurity among informal workers**

| Population | Low Income | Medium Income | High Income | Pattern | p-value | n |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------|---------|---|
| Elderly | 8.7% insecure | 2.6% insecure | 4.9% insecure | U-shaped | p=0.007 | 863 |
| Disabled | 14.3% insecure | **31.1%** insecure | 11.8% insecure | Peak at medium | p=0.031 | 152 |
| Informal Workers | 8.3% insecure | 6.7% insecure | **16.9%** insecure | High at top | p<0.001 | 2,048 |

**Report Use:** Challenges simple income-based food security interventions. High-income informal workers (avg 30,983 THB) show 16.9% food insecurity, suggesting income volatility is the issue.

---

### 6. HOUSING OWNERSHIP → INCOME
**Home ownership correlates with higher income**

| Population | Homeowners | Renters | Difference | p-value | n |
|------------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|---|
| General | 26,687 THB | 23,855 THB | **+2,832 THB** | p=0.046 | 1,279 |
| Elderly | 5,322 THB | 3,753 THB | **+1,568 THB** | p=0.007 | 863 |

**Report Use:** Housing as wealth accumulation and poverty protection, especially for elderly.

---

### 7. HOUSING OWNERSHIP → CHRONIC DISEASE
**Homeowners show higher chronic disease (likely age confounding)**

| Population | Homeowners | Renters | Difference | p-value | n |
|------------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|---|
| Disabled | **85.0%** | 73.0% | **+12.0pp** | p=0.002 | 638 |
| Informal Workers | **60.0%** | 47.3% | **+12.7pp** | p<0.001 | 2,645 |

**Report Use:** Demonstrates age confounding - homeowners are older and have more chronic disease. Use cautiously.

## KEY NARRATIVE THEMES

### Theme 1: Income as Critical Healthcare Determinant
**Evidence:**
- Low-income elderly: 44.8% skip medical care (p<0.001)
- Low-income disabled: 53.6% skip medical care (p=0.017)
- Effect size: 35pp difference between low and high income

**Report Integration:** "Income represents the most significant barrier to healthcare access in our study. Among low-income elderly (average 291 THB/month), nearly half (44.8%) reported skipping medical care, compared to only 9.7% of high-income elderly—a 35.2 percentage point difference (p<0.001, n=863). The situation is even more dire for low-income disabled individuals, where 53.6% skip care (p=0.017, n=152)."

---

### Theme 2: Education as Upstream Intervention Point
**Evidence:**
- Education→Income: +11,000-18,000 THB gain (p<0.001)
- Education→Healthcare Access: -10.1pp care avoidance (p<0.001)
- Strongest effect among informal workers: +17,756 THB

**Report Integration:** "Education emerges as a critical upstream determinant with cascading effects. Among informal workers, high education is associated with 17,756 THB higher monthly income compared to low education (p<0.001, n=2,048). This education-income pathway subsequently impacts healthcare access: elderly with low education are 2.4 times more likely to skip medical care than those with high education (17.3% vs 7.2%, p<0.001, n=2,986)."

---

### Theme 3: Chronic Disease Reduces Physical Activity
**Evidence:**
- Elderly: -11.1pp exercise rate (p<0.001)
- Disabled: -16.2pp exercise rate (p<0.001)
- Informal Workers: -10.2pp exercise rate (p<0.001)

**Report Integration:** "Chronic disease significantly reduces physical activity across all vulnerable populations. Among disabled individuals with chronic disease, only 26.8% exercise regularly compared to 43.0% without chronic disease—a 16.2 percentage point difference (p<0.001, n=638). This suggests a vicious cycle where chronic disease reduces physical activity, potentially worsening health outcomes."

---

### Theme 4: Informal Work and Income Volatility
**Evidence:**
- High-income informal workers: 16.9% food insecure (vs 8.3% low-income)
- Pattern unique to informal workers
- Suggests income volatility, not just income level

**Report Integration:** "Among informal workers, we observed a paradoxical pattern where high-income earners (average 30,983 THB/month) showed the highest food insecurity rate at 16.9%, compared to 8.3% among low-income workers (p<0.001, n=2,048). This counter-intuitive finding suggests that income volatility and irregular work patterns—not just income level—drive food insecurity among informal workers."
