## Abstract

A comprehensive health equity monitoring system that integrates survey-based Social Determinants of Health Equity (SDHE) indicators with facility-based Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) indicators to analyze health disparities across 50 districts of Bangkok, Thailand. The system employs automated population classification algorithms, statistical quality assurance with minimum sample size enforcement, reverse indicator intelligence for negative health outcomes, and multi-dimensional correlation analysis with policy-relevant interpretations in multiple languages.

---

## Background of the Invention

### Problem Statement
Traditional health monitoring systems face several limitations:
1. Separate analysis of health outcomes and infrastructure availability
2. Lack of automated vulnerable population identification
3. No statistical quality assurance for small sample sizes
4. Difficulty interpreting negative health indicators (diseases, problems)
5. Limited correlation analysis for policy decision-making
6. Language barriers in multilingual contexts

### Prior Art Limitations
Existing health dashboards typically:
- Focus on either population health OR infrastructure, not both
- Require manual population group classification
- Do not enforce minimum sample size requirements
- Lack intelligent handling of reverse indicators
- Provide limited statistical correlation analysis
- Operate in single language only

---

## Detailed Description of the Invention

### 1. Automatic Indicator Analysis from Raw Survey Data

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:363-809](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:363-809)

#### Core Innovation: Zero-Configuration Data Processing

The system features a **fully automated indicator analysis engine** that transforms raw survey data directly into meaningful health equity indicators without requiring data cleaning, preprocessing, or manual configuration. Users simply upload the `survey_sampling.csv` file, and the system automatically:

1. **Recognizes data structure** from CSV headers
2. **Maps survey fields** to health indicators
3. **Applies domain-specific logic** (single-field, multi-field, custom calculations)
4. **Validates data quality** (null handling, range checks)
5. **Generates comprehensive results** across 8 domains and 60+ indicators

#### Indicator Mapping Architecture

**Three-Tier Mapping System:**

**Tier 1: Simple Single-Field Indicators**
```javascript
unemployment_rate: {
  field: 'occupation_status',
  condition: (val) => val === 0
}
// Automatically recognizes column "occupation_status" and applies condition
```

**Tier 2: Multi-Field Compound Indicators**
```javascript
vulnerable_employment: {
  fields: ['occupation_status', 'occupation_contract'],
  condition: (r) => r.occupation_status === 1 && r.occupation_contract === 0
}
// Automatically combines multiple columns with logical operators
```

**Tier 3: Custom Calculation Functions**
```javascript
catastrophic_health_spending_household: {
  calculation: (records) => {
    const validRecords = records.filter(r =>
      r.hh_health_expense !== null &&
      r.income !== null &&
      r.income > 0
    );

    const catastrophicHouseholds = validRecords.filter(r => {
      const monthlyIncome = r.income_type === 1 ? r.income * 30 : r.income;
      const healthSpendingRatio = (r.hh_health_expense / monthlyIncome) * 100;
      return healthSpendingRatio > 40;
    });

    return (catastrophicHouseholds.length / validRecords.length) * 100;
  }
}
// Automatically performs complex calculations across multiple fields
```

#### Automatic Multi-Dimensional Disaggregation Engine

**Location:** [DataProcessor.js:1176-1273](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:1176-1273)

The system features an **automatic multi-dimensional disaggregation engine** that breaks down all indicators by geographic and demographic dimensions without manual configuration:

**Disaggregation Dimensions:**
```javascript
// Automatic extraction of dimensions from raw data
const domains = Object.keys(this.indicatorMappings);  // 8 domains
const populationGroups = ['informal_workers', 'elderly', 'disabled', 'lgbtq', 'normal_population'];
const districts = [...new Set(this.surveyData.map(r => r.district_name))];  // 50 districts
```

**Hierarchical Data Structure:**
```
Domain (8)
  ├─ District (50 + Bangkok Overall)
      ├─ Population Group (5 for SDHE, 'all' for IMD)
          ├─ Indicator (5-10 per domain)
              └─ {value, sample_size, population, absolute_count}
```

**Intelligent Disaggregation Logic:**

**For SDHE Indicators (Population-Specific):**
```javascript
// Calculate per population group
populationGroups.forEach(group => {
  const allRecords = this.surveyData.filter(r => r.population_group === group);
  results[domain]['Bangkok Overall'][group] = calculateIndicators(allRecords);
});

// Calculate per district AND population group
districts.forEach(district => {
  populationGroups.forEach(group => {
    const records = this.surveyData.filter(r =>
      r.district_name === district && r.population_group === group
    );
    results[domain][district][group] = calculateIndicators(records);
  });
});
```
**Result:** 8 domains × 51 districts × 5 population groups = **2,040 disaggregated data cells** for SDHE indicators

**For IMD Indicators (Infrastructure-Wide):**
```javascript
// Calculate for all populations combined
results[domain]['Bangkok Overall']['all'] = calculateIndicators(this.surveyData);

districts.forEach(district => {
  const records = this.surveyData.filter(r => r.district_name === district);
  results[domain][district]['all'] = calculateIndicators(records);
});
```
**Result:** 3 domains × 51 districts × 1 population group = **153 disaggregated data cells** for IMD indicators

**Total Disaggregated Outputs:**
- **2,193 unique data cells** (2,040 SDHE + 153 IMD)
- **60+ indicators** per cell
- **~131,580 individual indicator values** calculated automatically
- All from a single CSV upload with zero configuration

**Automatic Bangkok Overall Aggregation:**
```javascript
// City-wide aggregation across all districts
const allRecords = this.surveyData.filter(r => r.population_group === group);
results[domain]['Bangkok Overall'][group] = calculateIndicators(allRecords);
```
- Provides city-wide benchmarks
- Enables district-to-city comparisons
- Weighted by actual sample sizes

**Query Interface:**
```javascript
getIndicatorData(domain, district, populationGroup, indicatorType) {
  // Instant retrieval from pre-computed disaggregated results
  return this.sdheResults[domain][district][populationGroup];
}
```

**Disaggregation Advantages:**
1. **No manual subsetting** - System automatically filters data by all dimension combinations
2. **Consistent methodology** - Same calculation logic applied across all cells
3. **Complete coverage** - Every possible combination pre-computed
4. **Instant querying** - No runtime aggregation needed
5. **Quality tracking** - Sample sizes preserved for every disaggregation

3. **Multi-tier logic system** - Single-field, multi-field, and custom calculations
4. **Built-in validation** - Data quality checks integrated into calculation pipeline
5. **Self-documenting structure** - Code serves as both logic and documentation

**Comparison to Prior Art:**
- Traditional systems require ETL pipelines, data cleaning scripts, configuration files
- This system: CSV in → indicators out (one step)
- Prior art: Manual indicator calculation in statistical software
- This system: Automatic recognition and calculation of 60+ indicators
- Existing dashboards: Require pre-calculated indicator values
- This system: Calculates from raw survey responses in real-time

**Technical Merit:**
The automatic indicator analysis engine represents a significant advancement in health informatics by eliminating the barrier between raw survey data and actionable health equity insights. The declarative mapping structure (`createIndicatorMappings()`) enables non-programmers to understand calculation logic while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale data processing.

### 2. Population Group Classification Algorithm

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:827-833](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:827-833)

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
classifyPopulationGroup(record) {
  if (record.sex === 'lgbt') return 'lgbtq';
  if (record.age >= 60) return 'elderly';
  if (record.disable_status === 1) return 'disabled';
  if (record.occupation_status === 1 && record.occupation_contract === 0)
    return 'informal_workers';
  return 'normal_population';
}
```

**Classification Logic:**
- **LGBT Community**: Self-identified (`sex === 'lgbt'`)
- **Elderly**: Age-based (`age >= 60`)
- **People with Disabilities**: Self-reported (`disable_status === 1`)
- **Informal Workers**: Employed without formal contract (`occupation_status === 1 AND occupation_contract === 0`)
- **Normal Population**: Default fallback category

**Novelty:** Automated hierarchical classification from survey data without manual intervention, enabling real-time vulnerable population identification.

---

### 2. Statistical Quality Assurance System

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:24-25, 839-1119](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:24-25)

**Minimum Sample Size Enforcement:**
```javascript
this.MINIMUM_SAMPLE_SIZE = 5; // Minimum sample size requirement

const hasMinimumSample = records.length >= this.MINIMUM_SAMPLE_SIZE;

if (!hasMinimumSample) {
  results[indicator] = {
    value: null,
    sample_size: records.length,
    noData: true,
    insufficientSample: true
  };
}
```

**Quality Assurance Features:**
- Enforces minimum n ≥ 5 respondents per district per population group
- Automatic flagging of insufficient data with `insufficientSample` marker
- Sample size tracking across all calculations
- Special validation for financial indicators (income > 0)
- BMI range validation for health indicators
- Null/undefined value exclusion from calculations

**Novelty:** Proactive statistical reliability guarantee with transparent data quality indicators, preventing unreliable conclusions from small samples.

---

### 3. Multi-Level Aggregation Engine

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:1176-1273](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:1176-1273)

**Hierarchical Data Structure:**
```
Domain (8 domains)
  ├─ District (50 districts + Bangkok Overall)
      ├─ Population Group (5 groups for SDHE, 'all' for IMD)
          ├─ Indicators (5-10 per domain)
              └─ Value, Sample Size, Population, Absolute Count
```

**Special Processing Logic:**

**For SDHE Indicators (Survey-Based):**
- Calculate separately for each population group
- Use population-specific survey responses
- Apply age filters where appropriate (e.g., tobacco use ≥15 years)

**For IMD Indicators (Infrastructure-Based):**
- Calculate for 'all' population combined
- Use facility counts and population denominators
- Apply WHO benchmarks for healthcare supply

**Bangkok Overall Calculation:**
- SDHE: Aggregate all survey records by population group
- IMD: Sum absolute counts across all 50 districts and recalculate rates

**Novelty:** Intelligent framework-specific aggregation that handles population groups differently based on indicator type, enabling meaningful comparisons.

---

### 4. Reverse Indicator Intelligence System

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:842-892](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:842-892)

**Reverse Indicator Mapping (30+ indicators):**
```javascript
const reverseIndicators = {
  // Economic Security
  unemployment_rate: true,
  vulnerable_employment: true,
  food_insecurity_moderate: true,
  food_insecurity_severe: true,
  catastrophic_health_spending_household: true,

  // Healthcare Access
  medical_consultation_skip_cost: true,
  medical_treatment_skip_cost: true,
  prescribed_medicine_skip_cost: true,

  // Social Context
  violence_physical: true,
  violence_psychological: true,
  violence_sexual: true,
  discrimination_experience: true,

  // Health Outcomes (all diseases)
  any_chronic_disease: true,
  diabetes: true,
  hypertension: true,
  cancer: true,
  cardiovascular_diseases: true,
  // ... (21 disease types)
};
```

**Goodness Score Conversion:**
```javascript
if (reverseIndicators[indicator]) {
  // Convert reverse indicator: 0% bad becomes 100% good
  goodnessScore = 100 - rawValue;
} else {
  // Normal indicator: higher is better
  goodnessScore = rawValue;
}
```

**Domain Score Calculation:**
```javascript
const domainScore = goodnessScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0)
                    / goodnessScores.length;
```

**Novelty:** Automatic semantic reversal of negative health indicators for intuitive interpretation, eliminating confusion where "high disease rates" would incorrectly suggest good performance.

---

### 5. Healthcare Benchmark Integration

**Location:** [src/utils/DataProcessor.js:153-247](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:153-247)

**WHO Standard Implementation:**

**Doctor Density:**
```javascript
const doctorDensity = (totalDoctors / districtPopulation) * 1000;
// Unit: Doctors per 1,000 population
// WHO Benchmark: ≥2.5 (excellent), ≥1.0 (good), ≥0.5 (fair)
```

**Nurse Density:**
```javascript
const nurseDensity = (totalNurses / districtPopulation) * 1000;
// Unit: Nurses per 1,000 population
// WHO Benchmark: ≥2.5 (excellent), ≥1.5 (good), ≥1.0 (fair)
```

**Hospital Bed Density:**
```javascript
const bedDensity = (totalBeds / districtPopulation) * 10000;
// Unit: Beds per 10,000 population
```

**Specialized Service Access:**

**LGBT-Friendly Services (Absolute Count):**
```javascript
const lgbtFacilities = healthFacilitiesData.filter(facility =>
  facility.dcode === districtCode && facility.lgbt_clinic === 1
);
return { value: lgbtFacilities.length };
```

**Sports Facilities & Parks (Absolute Count):**
```javascript
const sportfields = sportfieldData.filter(sf => sf.dcode === districtCode);
const parks = parkData.filter(park => park.dcode === districtCode);
```

**Market Access (Per Population):**
```javascript
const marketsPer10k = (districtMarkets.length / districtPopulation) * 10000;
```

**Novelty:** Mixed calculation methodology using international benchmarks for healthcare supply while maintaining absolute counts for specialized services, enabling both global comparison and local resource assessment.

### 7. Specialized Calculation Methods

#### 7.1 Catastrophic Health Spending (WHO Methodology)

**Location:** [DataProcessor.js:398-418](src/utils/DataProcessor.js:398-418)

```javascript
catastrophic_health_spending_household: {
  calculation: (records) => {
    const validRecords = records.filter(r =>
      r.hh_health_expense !== null &&
      r.income !== null &&
