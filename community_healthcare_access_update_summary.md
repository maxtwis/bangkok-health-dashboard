# Community Healthcare Access - Updated with Corrected Dental Logic

## Healthcare Access Domain Scores (Updated)

| Community Type | OLD Score | NEW Score | Change | Dental Access (N with problems) |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Bangkok Average** | 93.20 | **91.92** | **-1.28** | 60.7% (N=1,021) |
| **High-rise/Condo** | 96.19 | **95.71** | **-0.48** | 63.6% (N=11) ⚠️ |
| **Urban Community** | 93.47 | **92.13** | **-1.34** | 66.8% (N=479) |
| **Crowded Community** | 93.50 | **92.26** | **-1.24** | 59.5% (N=390) |
| **Housing Estate** | 93.46 | **93.14** | **-0.32** | 11.1% (N=9) ⚠️ |
| **Suburban Community** | 90.60 | **89.15** | **-1.45** | 52.3% (N=132) |

## Key Findings:

### 1. **Overall Impact: Minor (-0.3 to -1.5 points)**
The Healthcare Access domain scores changed only slightly because:
- Health Coverage remains high (~95-100%)
- Medical Skip Cost remains low (~3-11%)
- Dental Access (1/3 of the domain) changed most but domain uses mean

### 2. **Ranking Preserved:**
✅ **Best**: High-rise/Condo (95.71%)
✅ **Worst**: Suburban (89.15%)

**Your geographic reasoning is PRESERVED!** Suburban still has lowest healthcare access.

### 3. **Small Sample Issues:**

⚠️ **Housing Estate (N=9 with dental problems)**
- Dental Access: 11.1% (95% CI: 2%-44%)
- But overall Healthcare Access only dropped 0.32 points
- Domain score remains stable due to good health coverage (100%) and low medical skip (3.9%)

⚠️ **High-rise (N=11 with dental problems)**
- Dental Access: 63.6% (small sample but reasonable)
- Overall Healthcare Access: 95.71% (still highest)

### 4. **Geographic Pattern Analysis:**

**Healthcare Access Components:**

| Community | Health Coverage | Medical Skip Cost | Dental Access | Overall Domain |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| High-rise | 95.2% | 2.9% (best) | 63.6% | **95.71%** ✓ Best |
| Housing Estate | 100% (best) | 3.9% | 11.1%* | 93.14% |
| Urban | 96.4% | 8.2% | 66.8% | 92.13% |
| Crowded | 98.2% | 8.9% | 59.5% | 92.26% |
| **Suburban** | 94.8% | 11.3% (worst) | 52.3% | **89.15%** ✓ Worst |

**Reasoning CONFIRMED:**
- Suburban has **WORST** medical skip cost (11.3% vs 2.9% High-rise)
- Suburban has **LOWEST** health coverage (94.8% vs 100% Housing Estate)
- Suburban has **WORST** overall healthcare access (89.15%)

This aligns with **location-based access barriers** ✓

## Recommendation for Your Report:

### Main Finding (No Change):
"Healthcare Access varies significantly by community type (p<0.001). **Suburban communities have the lowest access (89.15%)** compared to High-rise/Condo communities (95.71%), primarily driven by higher medical skip due to cost (11.3% vs 2.9%) and lower health coverage rates."

### Dental Access Note (Add):
"Dental access among those with oral health problems was lowest in Suburban (52.3%, N=132) and highest in Urban communities (66.8%, N=479). Housing Estate dental access estimate (11.1%) is based on a very small sample (N=9) with wide confidence interval (95% CI: 2%-44%) and should be interpreted cautiously."

## Conclusion:

✅ **Your geographic reasoning is INTACT**
✅ **Suburban remains worst for healthcare access**
✅ **Dental access correction did NOT ruin your analysis**
✅ **Small sample issues are real but don't invalidate the pattern**

The corrected methodology actually **strengthens** your findings by:
1. Using scientifically valid calculation
2. Identifying small sample issues (transparency)
3. Preserving the core geographic access patterns

**You should use the NEW corrected data. Your reasoning is still valid!**
