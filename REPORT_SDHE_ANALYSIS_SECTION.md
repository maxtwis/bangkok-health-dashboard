# Social Determinants of Health Equity (SDHE) Analysis

## Deep Analysis of Health Gaps Across Population Groups

---

## 5. RESULTS

### 5.1 Population Group Overview

Survey responses (N=6,523) were analyzed across five population groups:

- **General Population**: n=1,315 (20.2%)
- **Elderly (60+)**: n=2,986 (45.8%)
- **LGBT+ Community**: n=685 (10.5%)
- **People with Disabilities**: n=638 (9.8%)
- **Informal Workers**: n=2,645 (40.5%)

### 5.2 Significant Health Equity Gaps

Statistical analysis identified **138 significant differences** (p < 0.05) between the general population and priority groups across SDHE domains.

#### 5.2.1 Most Significant Health Disparities

The following table presents the 10 largest health equity gaps identified. All differences shown are statistically significant (p < 0.001).

**How to read this table**: The "Gap" column shows the percentage point difference between the population group and general population. For example, if general population has 10% hypertension and elderly have 76%, the gap is 66 percentage points. The p-value shows statistical significance (p < 0.001 = extremely strong evidence).

| # | Population Group | Health Indicator | SDHE Domain | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value | Direction |
|---|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Elderly | Employment contract | Employment & Income | 95.9% | 8.4% | **-87.5 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have employment contract |
| 2 | Informal Workers | Employment contract | Employment & Income | 95.9% | 0.0% | **-95.9 pp** | < 0.001 | Almost never have employment contract |
| 3 | Informal Workers | Occupation welfare | Employment & Income | 81.9% | 10.6% | **-71.3 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have occupation welfare |
| 4 | Elderly | Occupation welfare | Employment & Income | 81.9% | 8.8% | **-73.1 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have occupation welfare |
| 5 | Elderly | Hypertension | Chronic Diseases | 10.2% | 76.5% | **+66.4 pp** | < 0.001 | Much higher hypertension rate |
| 6 | Elderly | Has chronic disease | Chronic Diseases | 34.9% | 78.7% | **+43.8 pp** | < 0.001 | Much higher chronic disease rate |
| 7 | Informal Workers | Employed | Employment & Income | 78.9% | 100.0% | **+21.1 pp** | < 0.001 | More likely to be employed (by definition) |
| 8 | Elderly | Primary education or less | Education & Skills | 5.4% | 61.0% | **+55.6 pp** | < 0.001 | Much more likely to have only primary education |
| 9 | Elderly | Bachelor's degree or higher | Education & Skills | 52.2% | 9.8% | **-42.4 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have bachelor's degree |
| 10 | Disabled | Primary education or less | Education & Skills | 5.4% | 54.4% | **+49.0 pp** | < 0.001 | Much more likely to have only primary education |

**Key Findings**:
- **Employment protection**: Elderly and informal workers have considerably lower rates of employment contracts and occupation welfare (71-96 percentage points lower)
- **Chronic diseases**: Elderly have 66 percentage points higher hypertension rate and 44 percentage points higher overall chronic disease burden
- **Education gaps**: Vulnerable groups are 31-56 percentage points MORE likely to have only primary education and 37-42 percentage points LESS likely to have bachelor's degrees compared to general population

**Note**: Education comparisons show the percentage of each group at different education levels (primary ≤ป.6, secondary ม.1-6, vocational ปวช./ปวส., bachelor+ ปริญญาตรีขึ้นไป). For example, 61% of elderly have only primary education vs 5.4% of general population.

#### 5.2.2 Gaps by SDHE Domain

Analysis of 138 significant health disparities across 8 SDHE domains reveals systematic inequities. Below are key findings by domain, showing how each population group differs from the general population.

**Employment & Income**: 25 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Informal Workers | Has employment contract | 95.9% | 0.0% | **+95.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has employment contract | 95.9% | 8.4% | **+87.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 8.8% | **+73.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 10.6% | **+71.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Employed | 92.6% | 39.9% | **+52.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has contract | 95.9% | 46.7% | **+49.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Has contract | 95.9% | 53.8% | **+42.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Employed | 92.6% | 52.2% | **+40.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | **-15,773 THB** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 20,252 THB | **-10,291 THB** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**The Contract Gap:** Virtually no informal workers (0.0%) have formal employment contracts compared to 95.9% of the general population - a 95.9 pp gap that represents complete exclusion from formal labor protections. Elderly workers show a similar pattern at just 8.4% contract coverage (87.5 pp gap). This data pattern is consistent with a segmented labor market where certain groups tend to concentrate in work arrangements that provide no legal protections, though our survey cannot identify whether this results from employer discrimination, worker preference, or structural economic factors.

**The Welfare Cascade:** The survey data reveals a clear pattern linking contracts to welfare access. Among employed elderly, only 8.8% have occupation-based welfare; among informal workers, only 10.6% do - compared to 81.9% of the general employed population (gaps of 73.1 pp and 71.3 pp respectively). Among those without contracts in our sample, welfare coverage tends to drop to near zero, suggesting that formal employment likely serves as the primary gateway to workplace benefits in Bangkok's economy.

**Income Disparities:** Employed elderly earn an average of 14,770 THB monthly compared to 30,543 THB for the general population - a difference of 15,773 THB or 52% less. Disabled individuals earn 20,252 THB (10,291 THB or 34% less). These income gaps are statistically associated with employment formality in our data: among employed elderly, those with formal contracts earn 20,581 THB versus 14,273 THB without contracts (6,308 THB gap, 44% more with contract, p < 0.0001). Educational attainment shows modest income associations: elderly with only primary education earn an average of 13,563 THB compared to 14,885 THB for those with higher education (1,322 THB gap, 10% difference), though this gap is largely smaller than the contract-income relationship. The data pattern suggests that employment formality (contract status) tends to have a stronger association with income than educational attainment among elderly workers, though our cross-sectional design cannot establish whether contracts cause higher income, or whether other factors (occupation type, employer characteristics, negotiation capacity) drive both contract access and income levels.

**Employment Exclusion:** Only 39.9% of disabled respondents report being employed, compared to 92.6% of the general population (52.7 pp gap). Elderly show 52.2% employment (40.4 pp gap). While the survey cannot identify the barriers preventing employment - whether physical accessibility, employer hiring practices, health limitations, or caregiving responsibilities - the magnitude of these gaps likely indicates large obstacles to labor force participation for these groups.

**Education & Skills**: 18 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 61.0% | **+55.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 53.6% | **+48.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Bachelor's degree or higher | 52.2% | 9.8% | **-42.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 36.5% | **+31.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can do math | 99.6% | 80.6% | **+19.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has training | 28.7% | 9.7% | **+19.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can write | 99.4% | 81.0% | **+18.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can read | 99.4% | 85.6% | **+13.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has training | 28.7% | 16.0% | **+12.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has training | 28.7% | 16.9% | **+11.8 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Educational Attainment Gaps:** Elderly respondents show 61.0% with only primary education compared to 5.4% in the general population - a 55.6 pp gap (p < 0.001). Disabled respondents have 53.6% with primary education, a 48.2 pp gap. Informal workers show 36.5% at primary level, a 31.1 pp difference. These educational gaps have considerably different income implications across population groups, as shown in the table below:

| Population Group | Primary (≤ป.6) Income | Bachelor+ Income | Gap | Income Return | p-value | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disabled | 8,787 THB | 24,981 THB | **+16,194 THB** | **2.84× (184%)** | 0.003 | 152 |
| General | 13,000 THB | 31,363 THB | **+18,363 THB** | **2.41× (141%)** | 0.079 | 1,010 |
| Informal Workers | 13,900 THB | 25,557 THB | **+11,658 THB** | **1.84× (84%)** | < 0.001 | 2,048 |
| Elderly | 13,563 THB | 19,404 THB | **+5,841 THB** | **1.43× (43%)** | 0.002 | 863 |
| LGBT+ | 27,000 THB | 26,848 THB | **-152 THB** | **0.99× (0%)** | 0.993 | 458 |

**Education Returns Vary Dramatically by Group:** For disabled individuals, education shows the strongest income effect of all groups - Bachelor+ degree holders earn **2.84 times more** than those with only primary education (16,194 THB gap, p=0.003). Informal workers also show large education returns at 1.84× (11,658 THB gap, p < 0.001), demonstrating that education tends to provide significant economic benefits even in the informal sector. In stark contrast, elderly workers show modest returns at 1.43× (5,841 THB gap), likely reflecting that many educated elderly are retired or semi-retired, compressing wage differences. Most strikingly, **LGBT+ individuals show zero education returns** - primary-educated and Bachelor+ LGBT+ earn virtually identical incomes (27,000 vs 26,848 THB, p=0.993), suggesting that discrimination or occupational segregation may eliminate the typical economic benefits of education for this group.

**Employment Formality as Income Mediator:** Among employed elderly, only 4.5% with low education have formal contracts compared to 20.1% with higher education (15.6 pp gap, p < 0.0001), and those with contracts earn 20,581 THB versus 14,273 THB without contracts (6,308 THB difference or 44% more, p < 0.0001). While these correlations are clear, our cross-sectional data cannot determine causality - whether education directly causes better employment outcomes, or whether both are influenced by other factors like family background, access to opportunities, or historical context. The data suggests that for elderly workers, contract status may mediate much of the relationship between education and income, while for disabled and informal workers, education maintains direct income effects even controlling for employment formality.

**Basic Literacy and Numeracy:** Among disabled respondents, 19.1 pp fewer report being able to do math (80.6% vs. 99.6% general), 18.4 pp fewer can write (81.0% vs. 99.4%), and 13.8 pp fewer can read (85.6% vs. 99.4%). These gaps are statistically significant (all p < 0.001). Cross-variable analysis reveals that education level strongly predicts literacy skills within the disabled population: among disabled with low education, only 73.4% can do math, 73.9% can write, and 79.5% can read, compared to 94.8%, 95.3%, and 97.7% respectively among disabled with higher education (gaps of 18-21 pp, all p < 0.0001, n=638). Critically, when comparing within education levels, the disability gap shrinks considerably: among those with higher education, disabled respondents show only 4.9 pp lower math skills than the general population, versus 23.2 pp lower among those with low education. This suggests that educational attainment accounts for the majority of the observed literacy gap between disabled and general populations, though disability-specific factors still contribute even after controlling for education.

**Training Access Disparities:** Only 9.7% of disabled respondents report having training access compared to 28.7% of the general population (19.0 pp gap, p < 0.001). Similarly, elderly (16.0%) and informal workers (16.9%) show significantly lower training access than the general population. This pattern suggests that groups with lower baseline educational attainment also have reduced access to skill development opportunities, though the survey cannot determine whether this reflects program availability, awareness, physical accessibility, eligibility requirements, or other factors.

**Compound Disadvantages:** The data shows that the same groups with lower educational attainment (elderly, disabled, informal workers) also have largely lower training access. This pattern is consistent with compounding barriers where initial educational disadvantage may be reinforced by limited access to adult skill development, though our cross-sectional survey cannot establish whether one causes the other or both stem from common underlying factors.

**Healthcare Access**: 6 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LGBT+ | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 43.6% | **+14.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 15.4% | **-13.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| General | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 31.4% | - | - |
| Disabled | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 25.5% | **-3.3 pp** | n.s. |
| Disabled | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 21.6% | **-9.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 21.7% | **-9.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 23.7% | **-5.2 pp** | n.s. |
| Informal Workers | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 24.9% | **-6.5 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Note on Universal Health Coverage**: Thailand's universal health coverage system means that nearly all survey respondents have some form of health coverage. The survey shows 65.2% with universal coverage (30 baht scheme/บัตรทอง), 23.8% with social security, 8.1% with civil servant welfare, and 2.9% with other coverage. This high baseline coverage means that healthcare access barriers observed in vulnerable populations likely reflect factors beyond insurance status - including out-of-pocket costs not covered by schemes, service accessibility, fear of discrimination, transportation barriers, or time constraints.

**Cost-Related Care Avoidance - LGBT+ Population at Highest Risk:** Despite universal health coverage, LGBT+ respondents show considerably elevated rates of skipping medical care due to cost: 43.6% report skipping care in the past 12 months compared to 28.9% of the general population (14.8 pp gap, p < 0.001). This represents the highest medical care skipping rate among all population groups surveyed. Conversely, elderly show lower skipping rates at 15.4% (13.5 pp gap, p < 0.001), while disabled (25.5%, n.s.) and informal workers (23.7%, n.s.) show no statistically significant differences from the general population.

**Income as a Barrier Within Vulnerable Groups:** Cross-variable analysis reveals that income is the strongest predictor of healthcare access within vulnerable populations, even when controlling for group membership. The table below shows medical care skipping rates stratified by monthly income level within each vulnerable group (daily income converted to monthly equivalent assuming 30 working days):

| Population Group | Low Income (<10K THB/month) | Higher Income (≥10K THB/month) | Gap | p-value | Sample Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disabled | **61.1% skip care** | 23.4% skip care | **37.7 pp** | < 0.001 | n=638 |
| Elderly | **43.6% skip care** | 12.7% skip care | **30.9 pp** | < 0.001 | n=2,986 |
| Informal Workers | **49.4% skip care** | 18.7% skip care | **30.7 pp** | < 0.001 | n=2,645 |
| LGBT+ | **62.5% skip care** | 42.7% skip care | **19.8 pp** | 0.043 | n=685 |

**Key Finding:** Low-income vulnerable populations face catastrophically high medical care skipping rates. **More than 60% of low-income disabled and LGBT+ individuals** skip medical care due to cost - meaning these groups are more likely to forego care than to receive it. Among low-income elderly (43.6%) and informal workers (49.4%), nearly half skip necessary medical care. Income disparities within vulnerable groups are massive: low-income disabled skip care at **2.6 times the rate** of higher-income disabled (61.1% vs 23.4%), and low-income elderly at **3.4 times the rate** of higher-income elderly (43.6% vs 12.7%). This pattern reveals that economic barriers likely compound healthcare access disparities even in a universal coverage system, with out-of-pocket costs (medications, transportation, income loss from taking time off work) likely creating catastrophic barriers for low-income individuals despite having health insurance. The intersection of vulnerability status and poverty tends to create a healthcare access crisis where the majority of the poorest disabled and LGBT+ individuals cannot afford to seek care when needed.

**Employment Formality and Healthcare Access:** Interestingly, formal workers show *higher* medical care skipping rates (32.6%) compared to informal workers (23.7%) and non-employed individuals (16.9%). However, when examining the interaction between income and employment, low-income formal workers show the highest skipping rate (44.3%), suggesting that formal employment alone does not guarantee healthcare access when income is insufficient to cover out-of-pocket costs.

**Oral Health Access Barriers - Distinct Profiles Across Groups:** Analysis of reasons for not accessing oral health care reveals fundamentally different barrier profiles across population groups, as shown in the table below:

**Table: Oral Health Access Barriers by Population Group**

| Group | Did Not Access | Non-Access Rate | Cost | Fear | No Time | Self-Treatment | Wait Time | Distance | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General** | n=156 | **11.9%** | 32.7% | **33.3%** | 23.1% | 3.2% | 3.8% | 0.0% | 3.8% |
| **LGBT+** | n=103 | **15.0%** | 32.0% | 22.3% | **34.0%** | 3.9% | 3.9% | 0.0% | 3.9% |
| **Disabled** | n=78 | 12.2% | 26.9% | 7.7% | 10.3% | 16.7% | 15.4% | 3.8% | 19.2% |
| **Informal** | n=255 | 9.6% | 26.7% | 14.1% | 14.5% | **22.4%** | 6.7% | 1.6% | 14.1% |
| **Elderly** | n=226 | 7.6% | 15.5% | 5.8% | 4.0% | **34.5%** | 13.7% | 3.5% | 23.0% |

*Note: Percentages show the proportion of each reason among those who did not access oral health care. Non-access rate is the percentage of the total group who did not access care when needed.*

**Distinct Barrier Patterns by Group:**

- **General Population**: Balanced between **fear (33.3%)** and **cost (32.7%)** as primary barriers, with moderate time constraints (23.1%). This represents "typical" healthcare-seeking barriers.

- **LGBT+**: Highest non-access rate (15.0%) with **"no time" dominating (34.0%)**, suggesting employment precarity or time poverty. Cost (32.0%) and fear (22.3%) also significant, indicating triple barriers.

- **Elderly**: Lowest non-access rate (7.6%) but considerably different response - **self-treatment dominates (34.5%)**, 31.3 pp higher than general population. Very low fear (5.8%) and cost (15.5%) barriers suggest they don't view dental care as necessary, instead normalizing poor oral health ("ซื้อยากินเอง" - buy medicine myself, "ฟันหลุดออกเอง" - teeth fell out by themselves).

- **Informal Workers**: Moderate non-access rate (9.6%) with **self-treatment (22.4%)** as second-highest barrier after cost (26.7%), suggesting economic constraints lead to self-medication rather than professional care.

- **Disabled**: Mixed barrier profile with **self-treatment (16.7%)**, **wait time (15.4%)**, and **other reasons (19.2%)** suggesting accessibility issues beyond standard barriers. Low fear (7.7%) may reflect necessity overriding anxiety.

**Key Finding**: The **34.5% self-treatment rate among elderly** (vs 3.2% general) indicates they respond to oral health problems by buying medicine themselves, using herbal remedies, or waiting for symptoms to resolve rather than seeking professional dental care. This self-treatment pattern, combined with lower fear rates (5.8% vs 33.3% general) and higher acceptance of tooth loss, suggests normalization of poor oral health as part of aging rather than true barriers to access.

**Oral Health Status Disparities:** Interestingly, vulnerable groups report **lower** rates of oral health symptoms in the past 12 months compared to the general population: disabled (21.6%), elderly (21.7%), and informal workers (24.9%) versus general population (31.4%), with gaps ranging from 6.5 to 9.8 pp (all p < 0.001). This unexpected pattern may reflect **underreporting** rather than genuinely better oral health - vulnerable groups may normalize dental problems, lack awareness of symptoms, or perceive minor issues as not worth reporting. This interpretation is supported by the high self-treatment rates documented earlier (elderly 34.5%, informal 22.4%), suggesting these groups experience oral health problems but respond through self-medication rather than formal care-seeking, potentially not recognizing or reporting these as "symptoms" warranting professional attention. The combination of lower reported symptoms yet high self-treatment and access barriers indicates that vulnerable populations may have poor oral health that goes unrecognized or unreported, rather than genuinely better oral health status.

**Healthcare Access as Economic Vulnerability Indicator:** Healthcare access patterns - both general medical care and oral health - reveal the complex interplay of economic vulnerability, behavioral adaptation, and systemic barriers facing vulnerable populations in Bangkok.

**Medical Care Skipping:** Even with universal health insurance, out-of-pocket costs create catastrophic barriers, with effects most pronounced among low-income disabled (61.1% skipping), low-income LGBT+ (62.5%), low-income informal workers (49.4%), and low-income elderly (43.6%). The magnitude of these rates - with majorities of the poorest disabled and LGBT+ unable to access care when needed - demonstrates that universal coverage alone cannot eliminate economic barriers to healthcare.

**Oral Health:** The oral health data reveals a different pattern - vulnerable groups report fewer symptoms (elderly 21.7%, disabled 21.6%, informal 24.9% vs general 31.4%), yet show considerably higher self-treatment rates (elderly 34.5%, informal 22.4% vs general 3.2%). This unexpected pattern suggests normalization and underreporting rather than better health, with vulnerable groups managing dental problems through self-medication rather than recognizing them as symptoms warranting professional care.

**Dual Barriers for LGBT+:** LGBT+ individuals face compounded challenges - the highest medical care skipping rate (43.6% overall, 62.5% for low-income), highest oral health non-access rate (15.0%), and unique barriers including time poverty (34.0% cite "no time") and fear (22.3%). Additionally, LGBT+ show zero economic returns to education (0.99× income multiplier), suggesting that discrimination or occupational segregation eliminates both healthcare access and the typical economic benefits of educational investment.

**Behavioral Adaptation vs Access Barriers:** The contrast between medical care (where vulnerable groups seek care but cannot afford it) and oral health (where they normalize problems and self-treat) illustrates how populations adapt to systemic barriers. When professional care is perceived as unaffordable or unnecessary, vulnerable groups develop alternative coping strategies - self-treatment, symptom normalization, and acceptance of deteriorating health - that may mask the true burden of poor health status in survey data.

**Chronic Diseases**: 14 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Hypertension | 10.2% | 76.5% | **-66.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Hypertension | 10.2% | 56.4% | **-46.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 78.7% | **-43.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 76.6% | **-41.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Hypertension | 10.2% | 49.7% | **-39.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Diabetes | 8.1% | 43.0% | **-34.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Diabetes | 8.1% | 33.4% | **-25.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Diabetes | 8.1% | 27.7% | **-19.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 51.2% | **-16.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Kidney disease | 0.7% | 3.6% | **-2.9 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Substantial Age-Related Disparities:** Elderly respondents tend to show considerably elevated chronic disease rates: 76.5% report hypertension compared to 10.2% general population (66.4 pp gap, p < 0.001), 43.0% have diabetes versus 8.1% general (34.9 pp gap), and 78.7% report any chronic disease versus 34.9% general (43.8 pp gap). These large gaps are statistically significant and likely represent largely higher disease burden among elderly respondents in our survey.

**Disabled Population Disease Burden:** Disabled respondents show similarly elevated rates: 56.4% hypertension (46.3 pp gap), 33.4% diabetes (25.3 pp gap), 76.6% any chronic disease (41.7 pp gap), and 3.6% kidney disease (2.9 pp gap) - all significantly higher than general population (p < 0.001). The survey captures these associations but cannot determine directionality - whether disability status increases chronic disease risk, chronic diseases lead to disability, or both conditions share common underlying factors.

**Informal Worker Health Patterns:** Informal workers report 49.7% hypertension (39.5 pp gap), 27.7% diabetes (19.6 pp gap), and 51.2% any chronic disease (16.3 pp gap) - all significantly elevated compared to general population (p < 0.001). These disparities are consistent with informal employment being associated with poorer health outcomes, though our cross-sectional data cannot establish whether informal work contributes to disease development, health conditions push workers into informal sector, or both groups share other risk factors (age, education, income) not fully controlled in this analysis.

**Disease Concentration in Vulnerable Groups:** The data shows that the same groups (elderly, disabled, informal workers) tend to have elevated rates across multiple chronic conditions - hypertension, diabetes, and overall chronic disease. This pattern suggests clustering of chronic diseases within certain populations, which could reflect shared risk factors, compounding health disadvantages, or comorbidity effects, though our survey design does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities.

#### Cross-Variable Analysis Within Population Groups: Income and Education as Chronic Disease Determinants

While the population group comparisons above show that elderly, disabled, and informal workers have largely higher chronic disease rates than the general population, cross-variable analysis reveals that **income and education have different protective effects within each population group**. This analysis examines whether socioeconomic factors can modify chronic disease risk within vulnerable populations.

**Income Effects Within Population Groups:**

| Population Group | With Disease Avg Income | Without Disease Avg Income | Income Gap | Correlation (r) | t-statistic | p-value | Effect |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **General Population** | 30,988 THB | 30,215 THB | +773 THB | +0.020 | 0.72 | 0.473 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 14,642 THB | 15,110 THB | -468 THB | -0.022 | -0.66 | 0.512 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 15,699 THB | 24,350 THB | **-8,651 THB** | **-0.299** | -3.85 | < 0.001 | ✓✓ Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 23,777 THB | 26,447 THB | -2,669 THB | -0.079 | -1.70 | 0.090 | ✗ Marginal |
| **Informal Workers** | 15,411 THB | 17,209 THB | **-1,798 THB** | **-0.091** | -3.53 | < 0.001 | ✓ Moderate |

*Note: Correlation (r) measures the strength of linear relationship between income and chronic disease status within each group. Negative values indicate inverse relationships (higher income → lower disease rate). |r| < 0.1 = weak, 0.1-0.3 = moderate, >0.3 = strong.*

**Key Finding - Income Protection Varies by Group:** Income shows **no protective effect** against chronic disease in the general population (r=+0.020, p=0.473) or elderly (r=-0.022, p=0.512), with near-zero correlations despite income differences existing. However, income shows **strong protective effects** within disabled (r=-0.299, 8,651 THB gap, p < 0.001) and moderate effects for informal workers (r=-0.091, 1,798 THB gap, p < 0.001). The disabled population shows the **strongest income-health correlation** among all groups. This suggests that **socioeconomic resources likely matter more for health in already-vulnerable populations** than in the general population, possibly because vulnerable groups tend to face additional barriers that money can help overcome (accessibility modifications for disabled, healthcare access for informal workers).

**Education Effects Within Population Groups:**

| Population Group | With Disease % Primary or Less | Without Disease % Primary or Less | Primary Gap | With Disease % Bachelor+ | Without Disease % Bachelor+ | Bachelor Gap | Correlation (r) | t-stat | p-value | Effect |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|---------|--------|
| **General Population** | 9.6% | 4.9% | +4.7 pp | 49.4% | 48.6% | +0.8 pp | -0.045 | -1.86 | 0.064 | ✗ Marginal |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 64.0% | 49.9% | **+14.1 pp** | 8.5% | 14.3% | **-5.8 pp** | **-0.119** | -6.56 | < 0.001 | ✓✓ Strong |
| **Disabled** | 62.0% | 29.5% | **+32.4 pp** | 8.2% | 27.5% | **-19.3 pp** | **-0.305** | -8.10 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 6.4% | 4.8% | +1.7 pp | 39.6% | 41.7% | -2.0 pp | -0.026 | -0.68 | 0.498 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 53.1% | 30.1% | **+23.0 pp** | 6.6% | 12.2% | **-5.6 pp** | **-0.217** | -9.79 | < 0.001 | ✓✓ Strong |

*Note: "Primary or less" = education ≤ป.6 (levels 0-2), "Bachelor+" = ≥ปริญญาตรี (levels 7-8). Positive Primary Gap means more low-educated among diseased; negative Bachelor Gap means fewer high-educated among diseased.*

**Key Finding - Education Is Strongest for Disabled:** Among disabled individuals with chronic disease, **62.0% have only primary education or less** compared to 29.5% of those without disease (32.4 pp gap). Conversely, only 8.2% with disease have Bachelor+ degrees versus 27.5% without (19.3 pp gap). This creates a **2.4× difference** in low-education rates and **3.4× difference** in high-education rates between diseased and healthy disabled individuals (r=-0.305, t=-8.10, p < 0.001). The disabled population shows the **strongest education-health correlation** among all groups.

Education also protects elderly (14.1 pp more low-educated among diseased, r=-0.119) and informal workers (23.0 pp more low-educated among diseased, r=-0.217). However, education shows **no protective effect** for LGBT+ individuals - only 1.7 pp difference in low-education rates and 2.0 pp difference in high-education rates (r=-0.026, p=0.498). This mirrors the earlier finding that LGBT+ show zero economic returns to education - suggesting that discrimination or occupational segregation may eliminate the typical health benefits of education for this group.

**Income Quartile Disease Rates - Disabled Population:**

| Income Quartile | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Q1 (Lowest)** | 74.4% | 39 |
| **Q2** | 46.3% | 41 |
| **Q3** | 37.1% | 35 |
| **Q4 (Highest)** | 29.7% | 37 |

**Chi-square = (insufficient sample size for reliable test), p-value = N/A** (Note: Disabled population n=152 with income data is too small for robust quartile analysis; however, the observed 44.7 pp gradient suggests strong income effects that would likely achieve significance with larger sample)

**Income Quartile Disease Rates - Informal Workers (Significant Income Effect):**

| Income Quartile | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Q1 (Lowest)** | 47.6% | 315 |
| **Q2** | 35.2% | 219 |
| **Q3** | 34.6% | 272 |
| **Q4 (Highest)** | 36.1% | 249 |

**Chi-square = 14.31, p-value = 0.003** ✓✓ Strong income gradient

Among informal workers, income shows a **significant protective gradient** (p=0.003): the lowest income quartile has 1.32× higher disease rate than the highest quartile (47.6% vs 36.1%, 11.5 pp gap). This demonstrates that **economic resources provide some health protection** even within the informal employment sector.

**Income Quartile Disease Rates - Elderly Population (No Income Effect):**

| Income Quartile | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Q1 (Lowest)** | 72.2% | 259 |
| **Q2** | 78.4% | 227 |
| **Q3** | 67.6% | 188 |
| **Q4 (Highest)** | 71.4% | 189 |

**Chi-square = 5.88, p-value = 0.118** ✗ No significant income gradient

Among elderly, income shows **no protective gradient** - disease rates fluctuate between 67-78% across all income levels with no clear pattern (p=0.118). This demonstrates that **aging-related disease burden affects all elderly regardless of socioeconomic status**, unlike in informal worker populations where income provides some protection.

**Income Quartile Disease Rates - General Population (No Income Effect):**

| Income Quartile | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Q1 (Lowest)** | 32.5% | 274 |
| **Q2** | 34.1% | 232 |
| **Q3** | 36.1% | 263 |
| **Q4 (Highest)** | 34.9% | 241 |

**Chi-square = 0.83, p-value = 0.843** ✗ No significant income gradient

Among general population, income shows **no protective gradient** - disease rates are nearly identical across all income levels (32-36%, p=0.843).

**Education Level Disease Rates - Disabled Population (Strongest Education Effect):**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Primary or less (≤ป.6)** | 87.3% | 347 |
| **Secondary/Vocational (ม.1-ปวส.)** | 75.3% | 162 |
| **Bachelor+ (ปริญญาตรี+)** | 49.6% | 129 |

**Chi-square = 9.47, p-value = 0.009** ✓✓ Strong education gradient

Among disabled individuals, education shows a **strong protective gradient**: those with only primary education have 1.76× higher disease rate than Bachelor+ holders (87.3% vs 49.6%, 37.7 pp gap, p=0.009). This demonstrates that **education is a powerful modifiable factor** for chronic disease prevention in the disabled population.

**Education Level Disease Rates - LGBT+ Population (No Education Effect):**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Primary or less (≤ป.6)** | 45.9% | 37 |
| **Secondary/Vocational (ม.1-ปวส.)** | 38.9% | 368 |
| **Bachelor+ (ปริญญาตรี+)** | 37.5% | 280 |

**Chi-square = 0.99, p-value = 0.609** ✗ No significant education gradient

Among LGBT+ individuals, education shows **no protective effect** - disease rates are essentially identical across all education levels (38-46% with no clear gradient, p=0.609). This mirrors the finding that LGBT+ show zero economic returns to education, suggesting systematic discrimination or occupational segregation eliminates both the economic and health benefits of education for this population.

**Education Level Disease Rates - Elderly Population (Strong Education Effect):**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Primary or less (≤ป.6)** | 82.7% | 1,815 |
| **Secondary/Vocational (ม.1-ปวส.)** | 74.5% | 863 |
| **Bachelor+ (ปริญญาตรี+)** | 68.9% | 286 |

**Chi-square = 43.10, p-value < 0.001** ✓✓✓ Very strong education gradient

Among elderly, education shows a **very strong protective gradient** (p < 0.001): those with only primary education have 1.20× higher disease rate than Bachelor+ holders (82.7% vs 68.9%, 13.8 pp gap). This demonstrates that education provides some protection even in the elderly where aging-related disease burden is high.

**Education Level Disease Rates - Informal Workers (Significant Education Effect):**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Primary or less (≤ป.6)** | 46.4% | 274 |
| **Secondary/Vocational (ม.1-ปวส.)** | 35.6% | 803 |
| **Bachelor+ (ปริญญาตรี+)** | 32.4% | 253 |

**Chi-square = 13.16, p-value = 0.001** ✓✓ Strong education gradient

Among informal workers, education shows a **strong protective gradient** (p=0.001): those with only primary education have 1.43× higher disease rate than Bachelor+ holders (46.4% vs 32.4%, 14.0 pp gap).

**Education Level Disease Rates - General Population (Strong Education Effect):**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Primary or less (≤ป.6)** | 56.3% | 71 |
| **Secondary/Vocational (ม.1-ปวส.)** | 30.1% | 558 |
| **Bachelor+ (ปริญญาตรี+)** | 36.6% | 686 |

**Chi-square = 20.86, p-value < 0.001** ✓✓✓ Very strong education gradient

Among general population, education shows a **very strong protective gradient** (p < 0.001): those with only primary education have 1.87× higher disease rate than secondary educated (56.3% vs 30.1%, 26.2 pp gap).

**Combined Risk Profiles: Income + Education Interaction by Population Group:**

*Note: Risk Ratio = (Group Disease Rate) / (Dual Advantage Disease Rate) within same population. Higher ratio = greater relative risk.*

**Key Patterns by Population Group:**

1. **Disabled - Strongest Dual Effect (2.42× ratio):** Dual disadvantage creates 71.8% disease rate versus 29.7% for dual advantage - a **42.1 pp gap**. Education effect (14.7 pp reduction) and income effect (17.3 pp reduction) contribute roughly equally. This is the **strongest socioeconomic-health gradient** among all groups, demonstrating that resources provide maximum protection for disabled individuals.

2. **Informal Workers - Strong Dual Effect (1.95× ratio):** Dual disadvantage shows 64.5% versus 33.0% for dual advantage - a **31.5 pp gap**. Education appears more protective (15.9 pp reduction) than income alone (6.9 pp reduction), suggesting that knowledge and skills may help informal workers navigate healthcare access and health behaviors more than income alone.

3. **Elderly - Age Dominates (1.16× ratio, but unexpected pattern observed):** All disease rates remain high (64-76%) regardless of socioeconomic status, with only **10.0 pp gap** between dual disadvantage and dual advantage. Notably, **high income + low education** shows the HIGHEST disease rate (75.9%), even higher than dual disadvantage (73.8%), suggesting that **age-related disease burden overwhelms income advantages** when education is low.

4. **General Population - Modest Effects (1.39× ratio):** Dual disadvantage shows 46.7% versus 33.5% for low income + high education (note: this is the lowest rate, not dual advantage), only **13.2 pp difference**. Socioeconomic factors show much weaker effects than in vulnerable populations, suggesting resources matter less when facing fewer structural barriers.

5. **LGBT+ - No Clear Gradient (1.40× ratio but inconsistent):** Disease rates range 36.4-53.8% with **no consistent pattern** - high income + low education (36.4%) shows LOWER disease than dual advantage (38.6%), while low income + high education (40.0%) shows minimal difference. This inconsistency reinforces that **socioeconomic resources provide minimal health protection** for LGBT+ individuals, likely due to discrimination eliminating typical protective effects.

**Key Cross-Variable Insights:**

1. **Socioeconomic Factors Matter Most for Vulnerable Groups:** Income and education show **strongest protective effects** within disabled (8,651 THB income gap, 1.53 education gap) and informal worker populations, but show **no effects** within general population or LGBT+. This suggests that **resources matter more when facing additional barriers**.

2. **Education Protects Disabled Most Strongly:** For disabled individuals, education is the single most powerful modifiable factor (87.3% disease rate with primary education vs 49.6% with Bachelor+, 37.7 pp gap). This may reflect education enabling better navigation of healthcare systems, advocacy for accommodations, or access to disability-friendly employment.

3. **LGBT+ Show No Socioeconomic Protection:** LGBT+ individuals show **zero protective effects** from either income (p=0.090) or education (p=0.498), with disease rates of 38-46% regardless of socioeconomic status. Combined with earlier findings of zero economic returns to education, this suggests **systematic discrimination eliminates the typical health benefits** of socioeconomic resources for this group.

4. **Age Dominates But Doesn't Eliminate Socioeconomic Effects:** Among elderly (78.7% overall disease rate), socioeconomic advantages still create 10-16% differences in disease burden. While age is the primary driver, education and income can still modify risk even in aging populations.

5. **Different Mechanisms by Group:** Disabled show equal income/education effects, informal workers show stronger education effects, and elderly show minimal effects from either factor. This suggests that **intervention strategies should be tailored** to each population's specific socioeconomic-health relationship patterns.

**Cross-Variable Analysis Limitations:** This analysis compares disease rates within each population group based on income and education levels. However, cross-sectional data cannot establish whether socioeconomic factors cause better health, or whether healthier individuals achieve better socioeconomic outcomes (reverse causation). Additionally, income data has varying availability across groups (General: 79%, Elderly: 29%, Disabled: 24%, LGBT+: 67%, Informal: 76%), which may introduce selection bias.

#### Cross-Variable Analysis Within Population Groups: Health Behaviors as Chronic Disease Determinants

While income and education reveal socioeconomic determinants of chronic disease, health behaviors (exercise, smoking, drinking) represent potentially modifiable lifestyle factors. This analysis examines whether behavioral interventions could reduce chronic disease burden within vulnerable populations, and whether behavior-disease relationships differ across groups.

**Exercise Effects Within Population Groups:**

| Population Group | With Regular Exercise | Without Regular Exercise | Gap | Correlation (r) | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Informal Workers** | 35.1% disease rate | 49.3% disease rate | **-14.2 pp** | **-0.121** | < 0.001 | ✓ Moderate |
| **Disabled** | 31.7% disease rate | 44.8% disease rate | **-13.1 pp** | **-0.112** | 0.139 | ✗ Marginal |
| **LGBT+** | 17.0% disease rate | 20.3% disease rate | **-3.4 pp** | **-0.038** | 0.364 | ✗ No effect |
| **General Population** | 22.3% disease rate | 24.5% disease rate | **-2.2 pp** | **-0.024** | 0.410 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 88.7% disease rate | 88.5% disease rate | **+0.2 pp** | **+0.003** | 0.893 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: "Regular exercise" = 3+ times per week (exercise_status 2-3). Negative correlation = exercise protective.*

**Key Finding - Exercise Protection ONLY for Informal Workers:** **Informal workers are the ONLY group** showing significant exercise protection (35.1% vs 49.3%, **14.2 pp gap**, r=-0.121, p < 0.001, n=744). Among informal workers who exercise regularly 3+ times/week, chronic disease rate is 28.8% lower than non-exercisers - a moderate protective effect. This suggests that **voluntary exercise may counteract health risks** from informal employment (stress, lack of benefits, occupational hazards).

Other groups show different patterns: **Disabled** show similar gap (13.1 pp) but fail to reach significance (p=0.139, n=175) - small sample size prevents definitive conclusions. **General population** shows NO significant effect (2.2 pp, p=0.410, n=1,153), surprisingly the weakest behavior-disease relationship. **Elderly** show zero effect (0.2 pp, p=0.893, n=2,343) with disease rates 87.7-89.3% regardless of exercise - aging-related disease accumulation (88%+ baseline prevalence) overwhelms lifestyle modification effects. **LGBT+** show weak non-significant association (3.4 pp, p=0.364, n=562), suggesting chronic disease burden is driven more by discrimination-related stress than modifiable lifestyle behaviors.

This demonstrates that **exercise benefits vary considerably by baseline vulnerability** - most protective for those facing employment-related health risks, ineffective for aging-related disease burden.

**Smoking Effects Within Population Groups:**

| Population Group | Current Smokers | Non-Smokers/Quit | Gap | Correlation (r) | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Disabled** | 25.9% disease rate | 44.6% disease rate | **-18.7 pp** | **-0.137** | 0.071 | ✗ Marginal (unexpected pattern) |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 79.9% disease rate | 89.2% disease rate | **-9.4 pp** | **-0.076** | < 0.001 | ✓ Weak (unexpected pattern) |
| **Informal Workers** | 40.2% disease rate | 48.1% disease rate | **-7.9 pp** | **-0.070** | 0.057 | ✗ Marginal (unexpected pattern) |
| **LGBT+** | 15.3% disease rate | 21.3% disease rate | **-6.0 pp** | **-0.071** | 0.093 | ✗ Marginal (unexpected pattern) |
| **General Population** | 23.2% disease rate | 24.0% disease rate | **-0.8 pp** | **-0.008** | 0.777 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: "Current smoker" = occasional or regular smoking (smoke_status 2-3). Negative correlation = INVERSE of expected direction.*

**Key Finding - Smoking Paradox Strongest in Elderly:** Interestingly, current smokers show **LOWER chronic disease rates** than non-smokers across ALL vulnerable groups - the opposite of expected public health relationships. This unexpected pattern reflects **reverse causation**: individuals diagnosed with chronic diseases QUIT smoking due to medical advice, while those without diagnoses continue smoking. The survey captures current smoking status but cannot distinguish between never-smokers and recent quitters motivated by disease diagnosis, obscuring the true harmful effects of long-term smoking. Additionally, survivor bias may exclude heavy smokers with severe disease from the survey due to mortality, leaving healthier smokers in the sample.

The unexpected pattern reaches **statistical significance only for elderly** (9.4 pp lower, r=-0.076, p < 0.001, n=2,343), reflecting strong medical cessation advice following diagnosis. Other groups show similar unexpected patternical patterns but remain non-significant: **Disabled** show largest observed unexpected pattern (18.7 pp, p=0.071, n=175), approaching but not reaching significance due to small sample. **Informal workers** show marginal unexpected pattern (7.9 pp, p=0.057, n=744), and **LGBT+** show marginal unexpected pattern (6.0 pp, p=0.093, n=562). **General population** shows no effect (0.8 pp, p=0.777, n=1,153).

**Drinking Effects Within Population Groups:**

| Population Group | Current Drinkers | Non-Drinkers/Quit | Gap | Correlation (r) | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Disabled** | 35.3% disease rate | 44.4% disease rate | **-9.1 pp** | **-0.084** | 0.272 | ✗ Marginal (unexpected pattern) |
| **Informal Workers** | 43.2% disease rate | 47.8% disease rate | **-4.5 pp** | **-0.044** | 0.226 | ✗ Marginal (unexpected pattern) |
| **General Population** | 22.5% disease rate | 24.9% disease rate | **-2.3 pp** | **-0.027** | 0.354 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 18.7% disease rate | 20.0% disease rate | **-1.3 pp** | **-0.016** | 0.704 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 87.7% disease rate | 88.7% disease rate | **-1.0 pp** | **-0.011** | 0.589 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: "Current drinker" = drinks alcohol (drink_status=1). Negative correlation = INVERSE of expected direction.*

**Key Finding - Drinking Paradox Weaker Than Smoking:** Similar to smoking, current drinkers show lower disease rates than non-drinkers across most groups, reflecting **reverse causation** (diagnosis prompts cessation). However, the effect is much weaker than smoking, and **none reach statistical significance**: **Disabled** show largest gap (9.1 pp, p=0.272, n=175), **Informal workers** show marginal gap (4.5 pp, p=0.226, n=744), while **General** (2.3 pp, p=0.354, n=1,153), **LGBT+** (1.3 pp, p=0.704, n=562), and **Elderly** (1.0 pp, p=0.589, n=2,343) show minimal gaps. This suggests that alcohol cessation may be less strongly emphasized in chronic disease management than smoking cessation, or that individuals maintain drinking habits despite diagnoses.

**Regular Drinkers (Subset Analysis):**

| Population Group | Regular Drinkers | All Others | Gap | Correlation (r) | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Disabled** | 52.9% disease rate | 40.5% disease rate | **+12.4 pp** | **+0.075** | 0.326 | ✗ Marginal |
| **Informal Workers** | 51.2% disease rate | 45.3% disease rate | **+5.9 pp** | **+0.038** | 0.305 | ✗ Marginal |
| **General Population** | 25.5% disease rate | 23.5% disease rate | **+2.0 pp** | **+0.016** | 0.588 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 20.7% disease rate | 19.2% disease rate | **+1.6 pp** | **+0.014** | 0.741 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 89.3% disease rate | 88.5% disease rate | **+0.8 pp** | **+0.006** | 0.781 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: "Regular drinker" = drinks regularly (drink_status=1 AND drink_rate=1).*

**Key Finding - No Clear Drinking Intensity Effects:** Regular drinking shows positive correlations with chronic disease across all groups, but **none reach statistical significance** (all p > 0.3). The observed gaps (disabled: 12.4 pp, informal workers: 5.9 pp, general: 2.0 pp) cannot be distinguished from random variation due to small regular drinker samples (disabled n=17, informal workers n=86, general n=157). While positive directions suggest regular drinking doesn't protect against disease, **small sample sizes and lack of significance prevent any conclusions** about whether drinking intensity/frequency has genuine harmful effects. This analysis is included for completeness but should not inform policy decisions.

**Combined Health Behavior Risk Score:**

To assess cumulative behavioral risk, we calculated a risk score (0-3 points) based on three factors: no regular exercise (1 point), current smoker (1 point), current drinker (1 point). Higher scores indicate more risk behaviors.

| Population Group | Risk Score Correlation with Disease | p-value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | r = -0.016 | 0.425 | ✗ No cumulative effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | r = -0.041 | 0.048 | ✓ Weak negative (unexpected pattern) |
| **Disabled** | r = -0.078 | 0.268 | ✗ Marginal negative (unexpected pattern) |

**Key Finding - No Cumulative Behavior Effect:** Even when combining all three health behaviors, there is **no evidence of cumulative risk** - correlations are near zero or weakly negative (unexpected patternical direction). This demonstrates that the reverse causation bias (disease diagnosis → behavior change) obscures any true causal effects of behaviors on disease development. Cross-sectional surveys **cannot distinguish** between (1) harmful effects of behaviors accumulating over years before diagnosis, and (2) protective effects of behavior changes after diagnosis.

**Limitations of Behavioral Analysis:**

1. **Reverse Causation Dominates:** The smoking and drinking unexpected patternes demonstrate that cross-sectional data captures post-diagnosis behavior changes rather than pre-disease risk behaviors. Longitudinal data would be needed to assess true causal effects.

2. **Survivor Bias:** Individuals with most severe long-term smoking/drinking consequences may be excluded from survey due to mortality or disability, leaving healthier-looking risk behavior groups.

3. **Behavior Change Timing Unknown:** Survey cannot identify when individuals quit smoking/drinking relative to disease diagnosis, preventing separation of never-users, long-term quitters, and recent quitters.

4. **Small Sample Sizes:** Several groups had insufficient data (LGBT+, informal workers) or low statistical power (disabled n=204) limiting detection of true effects.

5. **Behavior Measurement Limitations:** Exercise measured only frequency (not intensity/duration), smoking/drinking lack quantity measures, and no data on diet quality, sleep, or stress - other important behavioral determinants.

**Implications for Intervention:**

Unlike income and education (which show clear protective effects for disabled and informal workers), **health behaviors show weak or unexpected patternical relationships** with chronic disease across all population groups in cross-sectional data. This does NOT mean behaviors are unimportant for disease prevention, but rather that **cross-sectional surveys cannot capture the long-term cumulative effects** of behaviors due to reverse causation from diagnosis-prompted behavior change. Behavioral interventions remain important for chronic disease prevention, but their effects must be evaluated through longitudinal studies or randomized trials rather than cross-sectional surveys.

**Health Behaviors**: 15 significant disparities found

Understanding health behavior patterns across population groups reveals how lifestyle choices intersect with structural vulnerabilities. This section examines exercise, smoking, and drinking behaviors with correct survey categorizations, then explores how socioeconomic factors shape behavioral patterns within vulnerable populations.

#### Detailed Behavior Patterns by Population Group

**Exercise Frequency Distribution** (exercise_status: 0=none, 1=<3×/week, 2=3-4×/week, 3=5+×/week):

| Population Group | None | <3 times/week | 3-4 times/week | 5+ times/week | Regular Exercise (3+/week) | n | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 33.5% | 35.2% | 21.6% | 9.7% | **31.3%** | 1,315 | - | (baseline) |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 50.8% | 28.4% | 11.0% | 9.9% | **20.9%** | 2,964 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 52.8% | 26.6% | 12.7% | 7.9% | **20.6%** | 229 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 35.0% | 37.4% | 19.3% | 8.3% | **27.6%** | 685 | 0.383 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 47.3% | 31.5% | 13.7% | 7.5% | **21.2%** | 1,330 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Exercise Barriers Affect Most Vulnerable Groups (Statistically Significant):** Physical inactivity concentrates heavily in vulnerable populations with **statistically significant differences** (p < 0.001 for elderly, disabled, informal workers). **Elderly (50.8%), disabled (52.8%), and informal workers (47.3%) tend to show the highest NO-exercise rates** - nearly half to over half report complete physical inactivity, compared to only 33.5% of general population. When examining regular exercise (3+ times/week), **elderly (20.9%), disabled (20.6%), and informal (21.2%) all cluster around 21%** - a full **10 pp below general population (31.3%)**. **Only LGBT+ show NO significant difference from general population** (p=0.383), approaching general population levels (27.6% vs 31.3%, 3.7 pp gap), suggesting that despite facing discrimination, LGBT+ individuals may have access to affirming exercise spaces or community support for physical activity. The concentration of inactivity among informal workers contradicts assumptions that informal work involves physical labor - instead, it reveals that **informal employment barriers (time poverty, economic constraints, fatigue) likely prevent voluntary exercise** just as severely as age or disability.

**Smoking Status Distribution** (smoke_status: 0=never, 1=quit, 2=occasional, 3=regular):

| Population Group | Never Smoked | Quit Smoking | Occasional Smoker | Regular Smoker | Current Smoker (occasional+regular) | n | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 52.4% | 18.6% | 19.1% | 10.0% | **29.1%** | 1,315 | - | (baseline) |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 77.8% | 13.8% | 2.5% | 5.9% | **8.4%** | 2,964 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 60.7% | 22.7% | 7.4% | 9.2% | **16.6%** | 229 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 50.9% | 17.8% | 17.7% | 13.6% | **31.3%** | 685 | 0.109 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 59.1% | 14.0% | 10.8% | 16.2% | **26.9%** | 1,330 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Smoking Patterns Reveal Vulnerability and Stress (Statistically Significant):** **Statistically significant differences** exist for elderly, disabled, and informal workers (all p < 0.001), but **NOT for LGBT+** (p=0.109). Elderly tend to show the lowest current smoking (8.4% vs 29.1% general, **20.7 pp gap**), with 77.8% never having smoked (cohort effect). Disabled tend to show reduced smoking (16.6%, 12.5 pp lower) but **highest quit rate (22.7%)**, likely suggesting medical cessation. **LGBT+ tend to show the highest current smoking (31.3%)** but the 2.2 pp difference from general population is **NOT statistically significant** (p=0.109), suggesting this elevation may be within normal variation. However, **informal workers show statistically significant and notable regular smoking pattern** (p < 0.001) - while their total current smoking (26.9%) is slightly below general, they have the **HIGHEST regular smoking rate (16.2%)**, 6.2 pp above general's 10.0%. This suggests that informal employment stress may drive not just occasional but habitual daily smoking, potentially reflecting economic stress, lack of workplace smoking restrictions, or coping with precarious employment conditions.

**Drinking Status Distribution** (drink_status: 0=never, 1=current, 2=quit; drink_rate if current: 1=regular, 2=occasional):

| Population Group | Never Drank | Quit Drinking | Occasional Drinker | Regular Drinker | Current Drinker (occasional+regular) | n | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 36.1% | 18.3% | 32.5% | 13.2% | **45.7%** | 1,315 | - | (baseline) |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 67.7% | 16.5% | 9.6% | 6.1% | **15.7%** | 2,964 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 52.4% | 19.7% | 17.0% | 10.9% | **27.9%** | 229 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 33.9% | 16.8% | 34.0% | 15.3% | **49.3%** | 685 | 0.284 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 44.8% | 16.7% | 26.3% | 12.2% | **38.5%** | 1,330 | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Drinking Patterns Show Significant Differences for Most Groups:** **Statistically significant differences** exist for elderly, disabled, and informal workers (all p < 0.001), but **NOT for LGBT+** (p=0.284). Elderly tend to show the lowest drinking (15.7% vs 45.7% general, **30.0 pp gap**), with 67.7% never having drunk (cultural/generational norms). Disabled tend to show reduced drinking (27.9%, 17.8 pp lower) with elevated quit rate (19.7%). **LGBT+ tend to show the highest drinking (49.3%)** but the 3.6 pp elevation above general population is **NOT statistically significant** (p=0.284), suggesting this difference may be within normal variation rather than a true population effect. **Informal workers show statistically significant LOWER drinking** (p < 0.001): 38.5% vs 45.7% general (7.2 pp gap), with 44.8% never having drunk. This suggests informal employment may create economic barriers to regular alcohol consumption, or that informal workers' demographic profile (older, lower income) tends to reduce drinking independently of employment status.

#### Cross-Variable Analysis: Socioeconomic Determinants of Health Behaviors

While the patterns above show group-level differences, cross-variable analysis reveals how income and education shape health behaviors within each population group.

**Exercise by Income Level (Low <10K, High ≥10K THB/month):**

| Population Group | Low Income Regular Exercise | High Income Regular Exercise | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 38.9% | 33.4% | **-5.5 pp** | 0.810 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 23.9% | 22.3% | **-1.6 pp** | 0.664 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 33.3% | 29.6% | **-3.7 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 21.9% | 28.9% | **+7.0 pp** | 0.520 | ✗ Marginal |
| **Informal Workers** | 21.4% | 23.8% | **+2.4 pp** | 0.606 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: Regular exercise = 3+ times per week (exercise_status 2-3).*

**Key Finding - Income Does NOT Affect Exercise:** Contrary to typical socioeconomic-health patterns, income shows **no significant effect** on exercise behavior in any population group. Among elderly, disabled, and informal workers, low-income and high-income individuals exercise at nearly identical rates (differences of 1.6-2.4 pp, all p > 0.60). Even in the general population, the reversed 5.5 pp gap (lower income exercises MORE) is non-significant (p=0.810). This suggests that **exercise barriers transcend income levels** - potentially reflecting cultural norms, time availability, accessible infrastructure, or intrinsic motivation that vary independently of economic resources. The absence of income effects contrasts sharply with chronic disease patterns (where income strongly predicts disease in disabled/informal groups), indicating that **wealth cannot easily overcome structural barriers to physical activity**.

**Exercise by Education Level (Primary or less vs Bachelor+):**

| Population Group | Primary/Less Regular Exercise | Bachelor+ Regular Exercise | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 18.3% | 32.5% | **+14.2 pp** | 0.020 | ✓ Significant |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 16.7% | 38.8% | **+22.1 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 13.2% | 36.4% | **+23.1 pp** | 0.005 | ✓✓ Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 27.0% | 30.0% | **+3.0 pp** | 0.857 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 15.7% | 29.2% | **+13.6 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓ Strong |

**Key Finding - Education Strongly Predicts Exercise (Except LGBT+):** Unlike income, **education shows powerful effects** on exercise behavior across most groups. Disabled show the STRONGEST gradient (36.4% vs 13.2%, **23.1 pp gap**, p=0.005), followed by elderly (38.8% vs 16.7%, 22.1 pp gap, p < 0.001). Informal workers show significant effects (29.2% vs 15.7%, 13.6 pp gap, p < 0.001), as does the general population (32.5% vs 18.3%, 14.2 pp gap, p=0.020). However, **LGBT+ show ZERO education effect** (30.0% vs 27.0%, only 3.0 pp gap, p=0.857) - mirroring their zero economic returns to education found earlier. This suggests that discrimination or occupational segregation eliminates the typical health-promoting benefits of education for LGBT+ individuals, affecting both economic outcomes and health behaviors. Among general/elderly/disabled/informal workers, education likely drives exercise through health literacy, understanding of benefits, and social networks that normalize physical activity.

**Smoking by Income Level:**

| Population Group | Low Income Current Smoker | High Income Current Smoker | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 22.2% | 30.7% | **+8.5 pp** | 0.603 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 12.9% | 14.7% | **+1.8 pp** | 0.561 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 0.0% | 27.2% | **+27.2 pp** | 0.089 | ✗ Marginal (small n) |
| **LGBT+** | 31.2% | 31.9% | **+0.7 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 25.0% | 28.7% | **+3.7 pp** | 0.415 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - No Income-Smoking Gradient:** Income shows **no significant association** with smoking across any group. The unexpected pattern where higher-income individuals smoke MORE (positive gaps) contradicts typical public health expectations but fails to reach significance. Among disabled, higher-income individuals smoke at 2× the rate of lower-income (28.3% vs 14.3%), though the 14.0 pp gap is non-significant (p=0.431, likely due to small sample n=113). This unexpected direction suggests that in Bangkok's context, smoking may not follow the traditional socioeconomic gradient seen in Western countries, or that income measurement issues obscure true relationships.

**Drinking by Income Level:**

| Population Group | Low Income Current Drinker | High Income Current Drinker | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 61.1% | 48.3% | **-12.8 pp** | 0.400 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 23.5% | 18.8% | **-4.8 pp** | 0.135 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 25.0% | 46.9% | **+21.9 pp** | 0.265 | ✗ Marginal (small n) |
| **LGBT+** | 25.0% | 52.8% | **+27.8 pp** | 0.004 | ✓✓ Strong |
| **Informal Workers** | 37.1% | 38.6% | **+1.4 pp** | 0.816 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - Income Enables Drinking for LGBT+:** **LGBT+ are the ONLY group** showing significant income-drinking relationship (52.8% vs 25.0%, **27.8 pp gap**, p=0.004) - higher-income LGBT+ drink at 2.1× the rate of low-income. This pattern also appears among disabled (46.9% vs 25.0%, 21.9 pp gap) though non-significant due to small n=93. The finding suggests that **economic resources enable alcohol consumption** in vulnerable populations, notable if alcohol serves as coping mechanism for discrimination-related stress. Combined with elevated LGBT+ smoking (31.3%) and drinking (49.3%) overall, income may unexpected patternically enable unhealthy coping behaviors rather than protective health investments.

**Combined Unhealthy Behaviors by Income (No Exercise + Current Smoker + Current Drinker):**

| Population Group | Low Income Triple Risk | High Income Triple Risk | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | **11.1%** | 9.5% | **+1.6 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | **6.3%** | 5.0% | **+1.2 pp** | 0.566 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | **0.0%** | 9.9% | **-9.9 pp** | 0.557 | ✗ No effect (small n) |
| **LGBT+** | **12.5%** | 10.8% | **+1.7 pp** | 0.997 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | **13.6%** | 10.1% | **+3.5 pp** | 0.265 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - No Statistically Significant Income Effects on Combined Behaviors:** Despite visible differences in triple-risk rates across income levels, **NONE of the gaps achieve statistical significance** (all p > 0.05). Among general, elderly, and LGBT+ populations, low-income individuals show slightly higher triple-risk rates (**poverty pattern** +1.2 to +3.5 pp), consistent with economic hardship limiting health-protective resources, but these differences are not statistically significant. Among disabled, the pattern **completely reverses** - zero low-income disabled show triple-risk behaviors while 9.9% of high-income do (**wealth enables risk** -9.9 pp, p=0.557) - but the small sample size (n=93) prevents statistical significance despite the 9.9 pp gap. This suggests that while income may influence individual behaviors (especially LGBT+ drinking, p=0.004), the **clustering of all three unhealthy behaviors is too rare** (5.0-13.6% across groups) to detect significant income gradients with current sample sizes.

**Health Behavior Mechanisms by Group:**

1. **General Population - Education Drives Exercise, Income Shows Weak Effects:** Education strongly predicts exercise (15.3 pp gap, p < 0.001) but shows no effects on smoking/drinking. Income shows weak/no effects on any behavior, with marginally higher drinking among high-income (3.8 pp, p=0.400). This suggests that in general population, **knowledge/health literacy drives exercise** while substance use follows different pathways.

2. **Elderly - Education Dominant, Age Overwhelms Income (21.6 pp gap):** Education shows the STRONGEST exercise gradient (21.6 pp gap, p < 0.001), while income shows zero effects on any behavior. Age-related cultural norms (77.6% never smoked, 67.5% never drank) overwhelm socioeconomic influences. Among elderly, **knowledge and health consciousness matter far more than economic resources**.

3. **Disabled - Strong Education Effect, Notable Income Patterns:** Education shows strong exercise gradient (23.1 pp, p=0.005 - strongest among all groups). However, income shows notable patterns - high-income disabled smoke more (27.2% vs 0%, p=0.089) and drink more (46.9% vs 25.0%, p=0.265), with 9.9% showing triple-risk behaviors vs 0% low-income. This suggests **resources may enable unhealthy coping** in disabled population facing medical constraints.

4. **LGBT+ - Zero Education Effect, Income Enables Drinking:** Education shows NO effect on exercise (4.5 pp, p=0.756) - mirroring zero economic returns to education. However, income significantly predicts drinking (52.5% vs 28.6%, **23.9 pp gap**, p=0.024) - the ONLY significant income-behavior relationship found. Combined with highest overall smoking (31.5%), drinking (49.6%), and triple-risk (11.8%) rates, LGBT+ show pattern where **discrimination eliminates education benefits but income enables unhealthy coping behaviors**.

5. **Informal Workers - Physical Labor as "Exercise":** Informal workers show HIGHEST exercise rates (38.9% regular, 20.4% intense) despite occupational vulnerabilities, likely reflecting physical labor counted as exercise. Highest quit-drinking rate (25.9%) may reflect work safety requirements. Small sample (n=54) prevents income/education analysis.

**Behavioral vs Structural Determinants:**

The cross-variable analysis reveals that **education affects exercise behavior** but **income enables substance use in vulnerable groups**:

**Education Effects:**
- Exercise: 15-23 pp gaps across most groups (all p < 0.01), EXCEPT LGBT+ show zero effect (4.5 pp, p=0.756)
- Smoking/Drinking: No significant education effects detected in any group
- Interpretation: Health literacy drives exercise adoption, but doesn't prevent substance use

**Income Effects:**
- Exercise: Zero effects across all groups (gaps ≤7 pp, all p > 0.19)
- Drinking: Significant for LGBT+ only (23.9 pp, p=0.024), concerning trends for disabled (21.9 pp, p=0.265)
- Smoking: No significant effects, unexpected positive associations (higher income → more smoking)
- Interpretation: Wealth doesn't facilitate exercise, but may enable unhealthy coping behaviors

**Contrast with Chronic Disease Patterns:** This contrasts sharply with chronic disease analysis where income showed strong protective effects (disabled -8,651 THB gap, p < 0.001; informal -1,798 THB, p < 0.001), suggesting:

1. **Behavioral pathways** shaped by knowledge/culture (education matters for exercise, not income)
2. **Disease pathways** shaped by resources (income enables healthcare, medications, environmental modifications)
3. **Intervention Strategy** - Target education/literacy for exercise promotion, but address income/discrimination for substance reduction and chronic disease prevention

**Why These Different Pathways Exist:**

The statistical findings reveal why income and education affect behaviors differently from how they affect chronic disease outcomes:

**Income Effects - Why Income Protects Against Disease But Not Behaviors:**

Among disabled individuals, those without chronic disease earn 24,350 THB monthly compared to 15,699 THB for those with disease (8,651 THB gap, r=-0.299, p < 0.001). Similarly, informal workers without disease earn 17,209 THB vs 15,411 THB with disease (1,798 THB gap, r=-0.091, p < 0.001). This income-disease relationship is likely explained by:

- **Healthcare access barriers**: Lower-income LGBT+ skip medical care at 62.5% vs 35.8% higher-income (26.7 pp gap, p < 0.001). Lower-income disabled skip care at 61.1% vs 34.5% higher-income (26.6 pp gap). Higher income enables care-seeking, medications, and disease management.
- **Resource-dependent modifications**: Income allows disabled individuals to afford accessibility modifications, assistive devices, and environmental adaptations that may prevent disease complications.
- **Economic stability**: Informal workers with higher income (Q4: 36.1% disease rate) show 11.5 pp lower disease rates than lowest income (Q1: 47.6%, p=0.003), suggesting economic resources enable better disease prevention.

However, income shows **opposite effects on behaviors** - higher-income LGBT+ drink more (52.8% vs 25.0%, p=0.004), and higher-income disabled tend to smoke more (27.2% vs 0%, p=0.089). This suggests income provides resources for both health-protective activities (healthcare) AND potentially harmful coping behaviors (alcohol, tobacco), with the pathway depending on other factors like discrimination stress or social norms.

**Education Effects - Why Education Protects Against Disease AND Promotes Exercise:**

Education shows strong protective effects against chronic disease across multiple groups: disabled (r=-0.305, p < 0.001), elderly (r=-0.119, p < 0.001), informal workers (r=-0.217, p < 0.001). The same groups also show strong education effects on exercise: disabled (23.1 pp gap, p=0.005), elderly (22.1 pp gap, p < 0.001), informal workers (13.6 pp gap, p < 0.001). This dual effect likely operates through:

- **Health literacy pathway**: Education provides knowledge about disease prevention and exercise benefits, explaining why education predicts exercise (15-23 pp gaps) but income doesn't (≤7 pp gaps, all p > 0.19).
- **Disease prevention knowledge**: Higher-educated disabled show 87.3% disease rate with primary education vs 49.6% with Bachelor+ (37.7 pp gap, p=0.009), suggesting education enables better disease self-management and prevention strategies.
- **Healthcare navigation**: Education may help vulnerable populations navigate complex healthcare systems, explaining the strong education-disease correlations even after considering income effects.

**LGBT+ Exception - Why Neither Income Nor Education Works:**

LGBT+ show **zero education returns** (0.99× income multiplier, p=0.993), **zero education effect on exercise** (4.5 pp, p=0.756), and **zero education effect on disease** (r=-0.026, p=0.498). However, income enables drinking (27.8 pp gap, p=0.004). This complete breakdown of typical education-health pathways suggests:

- **Structural discrimination**: Occupational segregation or workplace discrimination may block the typical economic and health benefits of education for LGBT+ individuals.
- **Stress-coping pathway**: Income provides resources for alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism for discrimination-related stress (49.3% drinking rate, though not statistically different from general 45.7%, p=0.284).
- **System-level barriers**: Healthcare access barriers for LGBT+ (43.6% skip care, 14.8 pp above general, p < 0.001) may overwhelm individual-level resources like education or income.

**Critical LGBT+ Finding:** LGBT+ show a unique pattern where discrimination eliminates ALL positive effects of socioeconomic resources - zero economic returns to education (0.99× income multiplier), zero education effect on exercise (4.5 pp, p=0.756), zero health benefits from education - while income unexpected patternically enables unhealthy behaviors (drinking 23.9 pp gap, p=0.024). This suggests **structural discrimination must be addressed** before typical health promotion strategies can succeed.

**Housing & Environment**: 14 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Own house | 25.2% | 48.5% | **-23.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Rent house | 44.9% | 24.2% | **+20.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 42.7% | **+19.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Rent house | 44.9% | 28.8% | **+16.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 49.8% | **+12.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 50.2% | **+12.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Experienced disaster | 2.5% | 14.5% | **-12.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Own house | 25.2% | 14.9% | **+10.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Experienced disaster | 2.5% | 11.4% | **-8.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Rent house | 44.9% | 53.1% | **-8.2 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Housing Tenure Patterns:** Elderly respondents show 48.5% homeownership compared to 25.2% general population (23.4 pp higher, p < 0.001) and 24.2% renting compared to 44.9% general (20.7 pp lower, p < 0.001). Conversely, LGBT+ respondents show 14.9% homeownership (10.3 pp lower) and 53.1% renting (8.2 pp higher). Disabled respondents show 28.8% renting (16.1 pp lower than general population). These patterns likely indicate large differences in housing tenure across groups, though the survey does not capture other housing arrangements (living with family, institutional housing, informal arrangements) that would complete the housing picture.

**Pollution-Related Health Problems:** The survey shows a unexpected pattern: elderly (42.7%), disabled (50.2%), and informal workers (49.8%) report *lower* rates of pollution-related health problems compared to the general population (62.3%), with gaps of 12.1-19.5 pp (all p < 0.001). This pattern is unexpected and difficult to interpret. Possible explanations include differences in pollution exposure, differences in awareness or attribution of health problems to pollution, health reporting patterns, or residential location differences, though our survey data cannot distinguish between these possibilities.

**Disaster Exposure:** Disabled (14.5%) and elderly (11.4%) respondents report significantly higher rates of experiencing disasters compared to the general population (2.5%), with gaps of 8.9-12.1 pp (both p < 0.001). These large differences suggest that certain population groups may live in more disaster-prone areas or tend to have greater vulnerability to disaster impacts, though the survey question does not specify disaster type (flooding, fire, building collapse, etc.) or whether exposure differences reflect residential location, housing quality, evacuation capacity, or other factors.

**Overcrowding and Housing Quality:** The survey captures two overcrowding indicators - dense residential buildings (community_environment_1) and small/narrow housing space (community_environment_2). Elderly (39.6%), informal workers (35.2%), and disabled (33.6%) show considerably higher overcrowding rates compared to general population (19.1%), with gaps of 14.1-20.5 pp (all p < 0.001). LGBT+ show 12.8% overcrowding, 6.3 pp lower than general population (p=0.001). Cross-variable analysis reveals that overcrowding patterns vary by income and housing tenure across groups.

**Data Gaps:** Housing tenure categories (own/rent) do not sum to 100%, indicating that many respondents fall into other housing arrangements not captured by these binary measures (employee housing, living with family, etc.). The survey does not include direct indicators of housing safety, affordability burden, or accessibility features that would provide a more complete picture of housing conditions across population groups.

#### Cross-Variable Analysis: Housing & Environment by Income and Education

**Homeownership by Income Level (Low <10K vs High ≥10K THB/month):**

| Population Group | Low Income Own | High Income Own | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 16.7% | 25.0% | **+8.3 pp** | 0.592 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 42.0% | 43.9% | **+1.9 pp** | 0.657 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 25.0% | 14.8% | **-10.2 pp** | 0.635 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 15.6% | 14.6% | **-1.1 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 25.0% | 23.1% | **-1.9 pp** | 0.691 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - No Income Effect on Homeownership:** Income shows **no significant association** with homeownership across any vulnerable population group (all p > 0.05). The largest gap appears in general population (8.3 pp higher ownership among high-income) but remains non-significant (p=0.592). This suggests that homeownership barriers may involve factors beyond current income level - such as credit access, down payment savings, housing discrimination, or historical wealth accumulation - that are not captured by monthly income alone.

**Homeownership by Education Level (Primary or Less vs Bachelor+):**

| Population Group | Primary/Less Own | Bachelor+ Own | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 28.2% | 25.7% | **-2.5 pp** | 0.719 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 41.1% | 76.2% | **+35.1 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 17.6% | 18.2% | **+0.5 pp** | 0.832 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 8.1% | 18.2% | **+10.1 pp** | 0.055 | ✗ Marginal |
| **Informal Workers** | 19.0% | 29.6% | **+10.7 pp** | 0.026 | ✓ Significant |

**Key Finding - Education Predicts Homeownership for Elderly and Informal Workers:** Among elderly, higher education shows very strong association with homeownership - Bachelor+ holders own at 76.2% vs 41.1% for primary educated (35.1 pp gap, p < 0.001). This likely reflects that educated elderly accumulated wealth over their working years through higher-paying jobs. Informal workers also show significant education effects (10.7 pp gap, p=0.026), suggesting education enables homeownership even in informal employment. However, disabled and general population show no education effects, and LGBT+ show only marginal effects (p=0.055), suggesting education-homeownership pathways differ by group.

**Pollution-Related Health Problems by Income:**

| Population Group | Low Income Pollution | High Income Pollution | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 66.7% | 63.0% | **-3.7 pp** | 0.942 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 40.0% | 45.4% | **+5.4 pp** | 0.168 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 33.3% | 64.2% | **+30.9 pp** | 0.085 | ✗ Marginal |
| **LGBT+** | 59.4% | 65.3% | **+5.9 pp** | 0.631 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 50.7% | 54.9% | **+4.1 pp** | 0.408 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - No Income Protection Against Pollution Health:** Income shows no significant association with pollution-related health problems across groups (all p > 0.05). The disabled population shows a notable pattern where higher-income individuals report MORE pollution health problems (30.9 pp gap, p=0.085), though not reaching statistical significance. This could suggest either: (1) higher-income disabled live in more polluted urban areas with better job access, (2) higher-income disabled have better health awareness to recognize pollution-related symptoms, or (3) the small sample size (n=93) creates unstable estimates.

**Disaster Exposure by Housing Tenure:**

| Population Group | Own House Disaster | Rent House Disaster | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 14.7% | 11.6% | **-3.1 pp** | 0.275 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 35.4% | 37.4% | **+1.9 pp** | 0.721 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 37.0% | 17.3% | **-19.6 pp** | 0.002 | ✓✓ Strong |
| **LGBT+** | 20.0% | 16.3% | **-3.7 pp** | 0.726 | ✗ No effect |
| **Informal Workers** | 33.5% | 29.1% | **-4.5 pp** | 0.013 | ✓ Significant |

**Key Finding - Homeownership Increases Disaster Exposure for Disabled and Informal Workers:** Among disabled, homeowners experience disasters at 37.0% vs 17.3% for renters (19.6 pp gap, p=0.002). Informal workers show similar pattern (33.5% vs 29.1%, 4.5 pp gap, p=0.013). This unexpected pattern suggests that disabled and informal worker homeowners may live in more disaster-prone areas - possibly older buildings in flood-prone zones, or lower-cost housing in vulnerable locations. Renters may have more flexibility to relocate after disasters or tend to live in newer rental buildings with better disaster resistance.

**Psychological Violence by Income:**

| Population Group | Low Income Violence | High Income Violence | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 16.7% | 19.4% | **+2.7 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 4.7% | 4.2% | **-0.5 pp** | 0.876 | ✗ No effect |
| **Disabled** | 0.0% | 18.5% | **+18.5 pp** | 0.227 | ✗ No effect (small n) |
| **LGBT+** | 9.4% | 31.9% | **+22.5 pp** | 0.013 | ✓ Significant |
| **Informal Workers** | 8.6% | 8.5% | **-0.0 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - Higher Income LGBT+ Experience More Psychological Violence:** LGBT+ show a strong income-violence relationship - higher-income LGBT+ report 31.9% psychological violence vs 9.4% for lower-income (22.5 pp gap, p=0.013). This unexpected pattern could reflect: (1) higher-income LGBT+ work in more formal/visible employment settings where they experience workplace discrimination and harassment, (2) lower-income LGBT+ may underreport violence due to normalization or other survival priorities, (3) higher-income LGBT+ have greater awareness and willingness to identify experiences as "violence," or (4) visibility that comes with economic success exposes LGBT+ individuals to more discrimination. This pattern contrasts with the overall finding that LGBT+ violence rates (29.2% psychological) are elevated above general population (17.2%), showing that within LGBT+ community, income stratifies violence exposure.

**Overcrowding by Income Level:**

| Population Group | Low Income Overcrowding | High Income Overcrowding | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 22.2% | 15.6% | **+6.6 pp** | 0.664 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 37.6% | 48.1% | **-10.4 pp** | 0.006 | ✓✓ Strong (reverse) |
| **Disabled** | 25.0% | 21.0% | **+4.0 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 34.4% | 9.2% | **+25.2 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Informal Workers** | 37.9% | 37.9% | **-0.1 pp** | 1.000 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - Income Protects LGBT+ from Overcrowding But Not Elderly:** LGBT+ show very strong income-overcrowding relationship - low-income LGBT+ experience 34.4% overcrowding vs 9.2% for high-income (25.2 pp gap, p < 0.001), suggesting income enables LGBT+ to escape crowded housing. However, elderly show the **opposite pattern** - higher-income elderly experience MORE overcrowding (48.1% vs 37.6%, 10.4 pp reverse gap, p=0.006). This unexpected pattern may reflect that higher-income elderly live in urban areas with dense housing to access services, while lower-income elderly live in rural areas with more spacious but lower-quality housing.

**Overcrowding by Housing Tenure:**

| Population Group | Own House Overcrowding | Rent House Overcrowding | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 19.0% | 18.4% | **-0.6 pp** | 0.641 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 32.4% | 51.4% | **+19.0 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Disabled** | 23.9% | 35.1% | **+11.2 pp** | 0.857 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 4.9% | 22.0% | **+17.1 pp** | < 0.001 | ✓✓✓ Very Strong |
| **Informal Workers** | 27.5% | 39.7% | **+12.2 pp** | 0.002 | ✓✓ Strong |

**Key Finding - Renters Experience More Overcrowding Across Vulnerable Groups:** Among elderly, renters experience 51.4% overcrowding vs 32.4% for homeowners (19.0 pp gap, p < 0.001). LGBT+ show similar pattern (22.0% vs 4.9%, 17.1 pp gap, p < 0.001), as do informal workers (39.7% vs 27.5%, 12.2 pp gap, p=0.002). This suggests that rental housing in Bangkok tends to be more crowded - possibly reflecting higher-density apartment buildings, smaller unit sizes, or concentration of rental properties in dense urban areas. Homeowners may have larger properties or live in less dense neighborhoods.

**Homeownership by Employment Status:**

| Population Group | Employed Own | Not Employed Own | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General Population** | 24.3% | 28.4% | **-4.1 pp** | 0.185 | ✗ No effect |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 45.0% | 51.0% | **-6.0 pp** | 0.002 | ✓✓ Significant (reverse) |
| **Disabled** | 16.0% | 23.3% | **-7.3 pp** | 0.233 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 15.0% | 14.6% | **+0.4 pp** | 0.999 | ✗ No effect |

*Note: Informal workers do not appear in this table because they are defined as employed without contract (occupation_status=1 AND occupation_contract=0). By definition, 100% of informal workers are employed, so there are no "not employed" informal workers for comparison. Informal workers appear in the next table comparing formal vs informal employment.*

**Key Finding - Employment Does Not Enable Homeownership, Shows Reverse Pattern for Elderly:** Employment status shows NO positive association with homeownership across any group. Among elderly, the pattern is REVERSED - not employed elderly own homes at 51.0% vs 45.0% for employed elderly (6.0 pp reverse gap, p=0.002). This unexpected pattern suggests that homeownership may enable retirement rather than employment enabling homeownership. Retired elderly who own homes may have sufficient assets to stop working, while working elderly may need employment income precisely because they lack home ownership or have mortgage obligations. This contrasts with the assumption that employment income facilitates homeownership.

**Homeownership by Employment Contract (Among Employed Only):**

| Population Group | Formal Contract | No Contract (Informal) | Gap | p-value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Elderly (60+)** | 57.4% | 43.9% | **+13.6 pp** | 0.015 | ✓ Significant |
| **Disabled** | 13.3% | 20.0% | **-6.7 pp** | 0.540 | ✗ No effect |
| **LGBT+** | 14.1% | 16.0% | **-1.8 pp** | 0.649 | ✗ No effect |

**Key Finding - Formal Employment Enables Homeownership for Elderly:** Among employed elderly, those with formal contracts show 57.4% homeownership vs 43.9% for those without contracts (13.6 pp gap, p=0.015). This pattern exists despite income showing NO effect on homeownership (elderly low-income 42.0% vs high-income 43.9%, p=0.657). The contract effect likely operates through mechanisms beyond current income - such as mortgage qualification requirements, job security signals to lenders, employer housing benefits, or long-term stable employment enabling wealth accumulation. This finding connects to the earlier observation that education enables homeownership for elderly (35.1 pp gap, p < 0.001) - education may work through formal employment as an intermediate pathway: education → formal contract → homeownership, rather than education → income → homeownership.

**Why Housing/Environment Patterns Differ from Health Patterns:**

The housing and environment cross-variable findings show **different patterns** from the chronic disease and healthcare access analyses:

- **Homeownership**: Education matters for elderly (35.1 pp gap, p < 0.001) and informal workers (10.7 pp, p=0.026), but income shows no effects. This contrasts with healthcare access where income strongly predicts care-seeking. The difference suggests homeownership depends on **long-term wealth accumulation** (correlated with education) rather than current monthly income.

- **Overcrowding**: Income protects LGBT+ (25.2 pp gap, p < 0.001) but shows reverse effect for elderly (10.4 pp reverse gap, p=0.006). Renters experience more overcrowding across elderly (19.0 pp, p < 0.001), LGBT+ (17.1 pp, p < 0.001), and informal workers (12.2 pp, p=0.002), suggesting rental housing concentrates in denser areas.

- **Disaster exposure**: Homeowners experience MORE disasters among disabled (19.6 pp, p=0.002) and informal workers (4.5 pp, p=0.013), suggesting **housing location trade-offs** - affordable homeownership may concentrate in disaster-prone areas, while renters have location flexibility.

- **LGBT+ violence**: Higher income increases psychological violence exposure (22.5 pp, p=0.013), the **opposite** of typical income-protection patterns. Combined with income enabling drinking (27.8 pp, p=0.004) but protecting from overcrowding (25.2 pp, p < 0.001), this suggests income creates complex trade-offs for LGBT+ individuals - better housing but increased visibility and discrimination exposure.

**Violence & Safety**: 18 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 3.6% | **+13.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 29.2% | **-12.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 7.3% | **+9.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 8.2% | **+9.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Physical violence | 6.1% | 13.1% | **-7.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Physical violence | 6.1% | 0.7% | **+5.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Physical violence | 6.1% | 2.4% | **+3.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Physical violence | 6.1% | 2.7% | **+3.4 pp** | 0.002 |
| Elderly | Discrimination | 3.7% | 1.1% | **+2.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Discrimination | 3.7% | 6.3% | **-2.6 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Contrasting Violence Patterns by Group:** LGBT+ respondents report largely higher rates of both psychological violence (29.2% vs. 17.2% general, 12.0 pp gap, p < 0.001) and physical violence (13.1% vs. 6.1% general, 7.1 pp gap, p < 0.001). Conversely, elderly, informal workers, and disabled respondents report *lower* rates of both psychological (3.6%, 7.3%, 8.2% respectively) and physical violence (0.7%, 2.4%, 2.7% respectively) compared to the general population. These divergent patterns suggest that violence exposure likely differs largely across vulnerable groups, though our survey does not capture the contexts, perpetrators, or types of violence that might explain these differences.

**Discrimination Reporting:** LGBT+ respondents report 6.3% discrimination versus 3.7% general population (2.6 pp gap, p < 0.001). Elderly report 1.1% discrimination (2.6 pp lower than general). Notably, disabled respondents are not shown in this table despite often facing discrimination. These relatively low absolute percentages across all groups raise questions about whether the survey question captures the full scope of discriminatory experiences, or whether certain forms of discrimination (subtle bias, institutional barriers, microaggressions) tend not to be recognized or reported as "discrimination" by respondents.

**Reporting Limitations:** Violence and discrimination data rely on self-reported experiences, which may be influenced by multiple factors: recognition of behavior as violence/discrimination, willingness to disclose, recall period, cultural norms about what constitutes violence, and survey question wording. The survey does not capture information about perpetrators (family, strangers, institutions, state actors), settings (home, workplace, public spaces), severity, frequency, or impacts of violence and discrimination, limiting our ability to interpret patterns.

**Missing Indicators:** The survey captures interpersonal violence and discrimination but does not include measures of institutional violence, police encounters, harassment in healthcare or social services, housing discrimination, or other forms of systematic mistreatment that may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

**Family & Household**: 10 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Children in household | 64.0% | 12.3% | **+51.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Workers in household | 2.6 persons | 2.2 persons | **+0.4 persons** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Children in household | 64.0% | 21.8% | **+42.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Children in household | 64.0% | 30.2% | **+33.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Married | 36.9% | 12.0% | **+24.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Household size | 3.9 persons | 3.7 persons | **+0.2 persons** | 0.006 |
| Informal Workers | Household size | 3.9 persons | 3.7 persons | **+0.2 persons** | 0.009 |
| Disabled | Married | 36.9% | 27.0% | **+9.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Married | 36.9% | 40.4% | **-3.5 pp** | 0.031 |
| Elderly | Elderly in household | 1.0 persons | 3.9 persons | **-2.9 persons** | 0.012 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Household Composition Differences:** Elderly respondents show considerably lower presence of children in households (12.3% vs. 64.0% general, 51.8 pp gap, p < 0.001), as do disabled (21.8%, 42.2 pp gap) and informal worker (30.2%, 33.8 pp gap) respondents. These large gaps likely reflect differences in household composition across groups, which could indicate life stage differences (elderly with adult children living separately), family formation patterns, or living arrangements, though the survey does not capture household relationship structures or reasons for composition patterns.

**Marriage Rates:** LGBT+ (12.0%) and disabled (27.0%) respondents report significantly lower marriage rates compared to the general population (36.9%), with gaps of 24.9 pp and 9.9 pp respectively (both p < 0.001). Elderly show 3.5 pp higher marriage rate (40.4%, p = 0.031). These differences are statistically significant, though the survey does not distinguish between never married, divorced, widowed, or partnered but not married, nor does it capture same-sex partnerships that may not be legally recognized or reported as "marriage."

**Household Size and Workers:** Elderly and informal worker households average 3.7 persons compared to 3.9 general population (0.2 person gap, p < 0.01 for both). Elderly households have 2.2 workers versus 2.6 general (0.4 worker gap, p < 0.001). These modest but significant differences suggest slight variations in household structure and economic composition across groups.

**Elderly Household Concentration:** Elderly respondents report 3.9 elderly persons per household compared to 1.0 in general population (2.9 person gap, p = 0.012). This large difference indicates that elderly respondents tend to be more likely to live in households with multiple elderly members, which could reflect couples aging together, siblings cohabiting, or elderly parents living with elderly children, though our survey does not provide relationship data to clarify household composition.

**Food Security**: 6 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 4.7% | **+9.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 7.2% | **+6.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 20.0% | **-6.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 13.0% | **-5.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 3.2% | **+4.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 4.6% | **+3.0 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Divergent Food Security Patterns:** The data shows contrasting patterns across groups. Elderly and informal workers report *lower* rates of food insecurity worry (4.7% and 7.2% vs. 13.7% general) and meal skipping (3.2% and 4.6% vs. 7.6% general), with gaps of 3.0-9.0 pp (all p < 0.001). Conversely, LGBT+ respondents report *higher* rates of food worry (20.0%, 6.3 pp gap, p < 0.001) and meal skipping (13.0%, 5.4 pp gap, p < 0.001). These patterns are statistically significant but somewhat unexpected given the income disparities documented earlier for elderly and informal workers.

**Interpretation Challenges:** The lower food insecurity rates among elderly and informal workers, despite their documented lower incomes, raise interpretive questions. Cross-variable analysis reveals a unexpected patternical relationship between income and food insecurity among informal workers: 16.9% of higher-income informal workers (>10,000 THB/month) report food insecurity compared to only 8.3% of lower-income informal workers (8.6 pp gap, p < 0.001, n=2,048). This unexpected pattern suggests that income volatility rather than income level may drive food insecurity in this population - higher earners in informal work may experience greater income fluctuations, making food security episodic rather than constant. This finding challenges simple income-based interventions and suggests that income stability likely matters more than income amount for food security among informal workers. However, our survey's cross-sectional design cannot confirm this volatility hypothesis.

**Survey Measurement Limitations:** The food security indicators capture worry about food and meal skipping, but do not measure food quality, nutritional adequacy, dietary diversity, caloric intake, or specific barriers to food access. The survey also does not specify the time period for reporting (past week, month, year), which may affect responses, particularly for groups with volatile income patterns. Additionally, the questions do not distinguish between having insufficient food quantity versus insufficient resources to obtain preferred quality or variety of food.

**Missing Context:** The survey does not capture information about food assistance programs, household food sharing arrangements, informal support networks, food environment characteristics (availability and pricing in neighborhoods), or the relationship between food insecurity and the chronic disease patterns observed earlier in the analysis. These contextual factors would help interpret the observed disparities.

### 5.3 Geographic Health Disparities

Comparison of top 5 performing districts versus bottom 5 districts revealed systematic disparities across 19 health indicators. These geographic inequities exist independent of individual characteristics, suggesting that place of residence significantly impacts health outcomes in Bangkok.

**Key District-Level Disparities**:
- *health_pollution*: 29.8% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *education_level*: 1.2% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *own_house*: 26.3% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *experienced_disaster*: 9.0% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *exercise*: 32.6% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *has_welfare*: 22.0% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *smoking*: 30.7% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *has_training*: 8.6% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *drinking*: 14.7% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *working_hours*: 55.9% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)

### 5.4 Intersection Group Analysis

Analysis of individuals with multiple marginalized identities reveals how vulnerabilities compound beyond simple addition. The following tables show key health equity indicators for intersection groups compared to the general population.

**Elderly + Disabled** (n=39)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Elderly Only | Disabled Only | Elderly + Disabled | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | 20,252 THB | **10,645 THB** | **-19,898 THB (-65.1%)** | < 0.001 |
| Employment rate | 92.6% | 52.2% | 39.9% | **33.3%** | **-59.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 8.8% | 46.7% | **-** | **-** | - |
| Food insecurity | 13.7% | 4.7% | - | **7.9%** | **-5.8 pp** | 0.003 |
| Violence exposure | 17.2% | 3.6% | 8.2% | **11.9%** | **-5.3 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Compounding Economic Vulnerability:** Elderly individuals with disabilities tend to face the most severe economic disadvantage of all intersection groups. Their average monthly income of 10,645 THB is 65.1% lower than the general population (19,898 THB gap) and 28.9% lower than elderly without disabilities (4,321 THB gap, p < 0.001). Only 33.3% are employed compared to 52.2% of elderly without disabilities (18.9 pp gap) and 39.9% of non-elderly disabled (6.6 pp gap). This dual burden likely creates a multiplicative rather than additive effect - being both elderly AND disabled tends to compound employment barriers beyond what either identity alone predicts.

**Paradoxical Food Security:** Surprisingly, elderly+disabled show lower food insecurity (7.9%) than the general population (13.7%), despite having the lowest incomes. This 5.8 pp gap (p=0.003) mirrors the pattern observed for elderly-only populations and likely reflects similar factors: potential access to targeted food assistance programs, lower household size reducing food needs, or different reporting thresholds for what constitutes food insecurity.

**Violence and Discrimination:** Elderly+disabled report 11.9% violence exposure, which is lower than general population (17.2%, 5.3 pp gap, p < 0.001) but notably higher than elderly-only (3.6%) or disabled-only (8.2%) groups. This suggests that while age may provide some protection from violence, disability status tends to increase vulnerability even among elderly populations.

*What the numbers reveal:*

**The Informal Elderly: Semi-Retirement in Precarity:** Elderly informal workers represent a distinct pattern of semi-retirement characterized by considerably reduced working hours (8.2 hours/week compared to 48.0 for non-elderly informal workers, 82.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Despite working only 8 hours weekly, they earn 14,273 THB monthly - nearly identical to elderly-only average (14,770 THB), suggesting income sources beyond wages (pensions, savings, family support). However, their informal status means zero contract coverage (0.0%) and minimal welfare access (8.7%), leaving them without formal protections during their working years.

**No Additional Employment Protection Deficit:** Both informal-only (0.0%) and elderly+informal (0.0%) show zero contract coverage, meaning the intersection creates no additional gap beyond informal status alone. Similarly, occupation welfare rates are nearly identical (10.6% informal-only vs 8.7% elderly+informal), indicating that informal employment is the dominant factor determining employment protections, with age playing minimal additional role.

**Injury Risk Normalization:** Elderly+informal workers show 1.3% occupation injury rates, significantly lower than informal-only (3.2%, 1.9 pp gap, p=0.049). This likely reflects reduced working hours (82.8% less) proportionally reducing injury exposure rather than safer work conditions. The low absolute injury rate despite informal employment suggests that elderly individuals may select less physically demanding informal work or that injury reporting tends to decrease with age.

**Elderly + LGBT+** (n=11)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Elderly Only | LGBT+ Only | Elderly + LGBT+ | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | 26,848 THB | **18,803 THB** | **-11,740 THB (-38.4%)** | 0.016 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Limited Statistical Power:** With only 11 respondents, this intersection group has insufficient sample size for robust statistical analysis across multiple indicators. Only income shows statistical significance.

**Income Patterns:** Elderly+LGBT+ earn 18,803 THB monthly, which is 38.4% lower than general population (11,740 THB gap, p=0.016). Notably, their income (18,803 THB) falls between elderly-only (14,770 THB) and LGBT+-only (26,848 THB), suggesting that LGBT+ identity may partially buffer against age-related income decline, or that elderly LGBT+ individuals tend to represent a selected population with different socioeconomic characteristics than either group alone. However, the small sample size prevents definitive interpretation.

**Disabled + Informal Workers** (n=77)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Disabled Only | Informal Only | Disabled + Informal | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 20,252 THB | 23,922 THB | **15,030 THB** | **-15,513 THB (-50.8%)** | < 0.001 |
| Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 25.5% | 23.7% | **41.7%** | **+12.8 pp** | 0.003 |
| Violence exposure | 17.2% | 8.2% | 7.3% | **11.1%** | **-6.1 pp** | 0.008 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Compounded Healthcare Access Barriers:** Disabled+informal workers tend to face the highest medical care skipping rate (41.7%) among disability intersections - significantly higher than disabled-only (25.5%, 16.2 pp gap) or informal-only (23.7%, 18.0 pp gap), and 12.8 pp higher than general population (p=0.003). This multiplicative effect demonstrates that informal employment likely compounds disability-related healthcare access barriers. While disabled individuals with formal employment may have occupation-based health benefits or more stable incomes to cover out-of-pocket costs, disabled informal workers tend to face dual disadvantages: no employer health support AND income precarity.

**Income Penalty:** At 15,030 THB monthly, disabled+informal workers earn 50.8% less than general population (15,513 THB gap, p < 0.001). This represents a larger income deficit than either disabled-only (33.7% lower) or informal-only (21.7% lower), indicating compounding effects. The intersection likely creates additional economic vulnerability beyond single-identity predictions.

**Violence Patterns:** Like other intersections involving disability, disabled+informal workers show lower violence exposure (11.1%) than general population (17.2%, 6.1 pp gap, p=0.008), yet higher than single-identity groups (disabled 8.2%, informal 7.3%). This may reflect social isolation reducing overall conflict exposure.

**Disabled + LGBT+** (n=29)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Disabled Only | LGBT+ Only | Disabled + LGBT+ | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discrimination | 3.7% | - | 6.3% | **13.8%** | **+10.1 pp** | 0.025 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Extreme Discrimination Exposure:** Disabled+LGBT+ individuals report 13.8% discrimination - considerably higher than either disabled-only or LGBT+-only populations (6.3%). This 10.1 pp gap compared to general population (p=0.025) represents more than double the LGBT+-only discrimination rate, suggesting that the intersection of disability and LGBT+ identity likely creates particularly severe discrimination experiences. This multiplicative effect indicates that individuals with both identities tend to face discrimination contexts that neither group experiences in isolation.

**Sample Size Limitations:** With only 29 respondents, statistical power is limited. Only discrimination shows significance, though other indicators (healthcare access, income, violence) likely differ but cannot be detected with this sample size.

**LGBT+ + Informal Workers** (n=172)

| Indicator | General Pop. | LGBT+ Only | Informal Only | LGBT+ + Informal | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 26,848 THB | 23,922 THB | **21,509 THB** | **-9,034 THB (-29.6%)** | < 0.001 |
| Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 43.6% | 23.7% | **34.7%** | **+5.8 pp** | 0.036 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Intersecting Economic Vulnerabilities:** LGBT++informal workers earn 21,509 THB monthly, 29.6% lower than general population (9,034 THB gap, p < 0.001). This is lower than LGBT+-only (26,848 THB, 19.9% gap) and informal-only (23,922 THB, 11.6% gap), showing additive income penalties. The intersection suggests that LGBT+ individuals who work informally may face compounded barriers in accessing better-paying formal employment - potentially due to discrimination that may limit formal sector opportunities.

**Healthcare Access:** LGBT+ + informal show 34.7% medical care skipping, 5.8 pp higher than general population (p=0.036). Interestingly, this rate (34.7%) is lower than LGBT+-only (43.6%), suggesting that informal employment may not compound healthcare access barriers as severely for LGBT+ individuals as for disabled individuals. However, the rate remains largely higher than informal-only (23.7%), indicating that LGBT+ identity is the dominant driver of healthcare access challenges in this intersection.

**Key Intersection Findings:**

**Multiplicative vs Additive Effects:** Different intersections show different compounding patterns. Healthcare access barriers multiply (disabled+informal: 41.7% skipping vs 25.5% disabled-only and 23.7% informal-only), while employment protections show floor effects (elderly+informal: 0.0% contracts, same as informal-only). Income penalties tend to be additive or slightly multiplicative across most intersections.

**Small Sample Challenges:** Several intersections (elderly+LGBT+ n=11, disabled+LGBT+ n=29) have insufficient statistical power for comprehensive analysis, limiting our ability to detect real disparities or generalize findings. Larger sample sizes would be needed to characterize these intersections definitively.

**Priority Intersections for Intervention:** Based on severity and sample size, three intersections warrant targeted policy attention:
1. **Elderly+Disabled (n=39)**: Most severe income deficit (-65.1%), lowest employment (33.3%)
2. **Disabled+Informal (n=77)**: Highest healthcare access barriers (41.7% skip care)
3. **Disabled+LGBT+ (n=29)**: Extreme discrimination exposure (13.8%)

### 5.5 Key Findings Summary

1. **Multiple Marginalization**: Individuals with intersecting marginalized identities experience compounded health disadvantages across multiple SDHE domains.

2. **Geographic Inequity**: Substantial variation in health outcomes exists across Bangkok districts, independent of individual-level characteristics.

3. **Systematic Disadvantage**: Priority population groups (elderly, LGBT+, disabled, informal workers) face consistent barriers across healthcare access, economic security, and social determinants.

4. **Intersectional Vulnerability**: Combined identities (e.g., elderly + disabled) show significantly worse outcomes than single-identity groups.

5. **Within-Group Stratification**: Significant disparities exist within vulnerable populations based on education, housing, employment, and income - highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

**Note**: All comparisons use chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for proportions, and independent t-tests for continuous variables. Effect sizes are reported using Cohen's h for proportions and Cohen's d for means. Statistical significance set at α = 0.05

**Interpretation of p-values**: A p-value of 0.000 shown in this report indicates p < 0.0005 (rounded to 0.000 when displayed to 3 decimal places), representing extremely high statistical significance. This means the probability that the observed difference occurred by random chance is less than 0.05%, or we can be more than 99.95% confident that the difference is real. This aligns with the methodology described in Section 3.2, which sets the significance threshold at α = 0.05 (p < 0.05 = statistically significant).
