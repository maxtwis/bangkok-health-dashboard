### 5.7 Key Findings Summary

1. **Multiple Marginalization**: Individuals with intersecting marginalized identities experience compounded health disadvantages across multiple SDHE domains.

2. **Geographic Inequity**: Substantial variation in health outcomes exists across Bangkok districts, independent of individual-level characteristics.

3. **Systematic Disadvantage**: Priority population groups (elderly, LGBT+, disabled, informal workers) face consistent barriers across healthcare access, economic security, and social determinants.

4. **Intersectional Vulnerability**: Combined identities (e.g., elderly + disabled) show significantly worse outcomes than single-identity groups.

5. **Within-Group Stratification**: Significant disparities exist within vulnerable populations based on education, housing, employment, and income - highlighting the need for targeted interventions.
