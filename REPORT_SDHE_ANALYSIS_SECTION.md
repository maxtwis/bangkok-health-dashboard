# Social Determinants of Health Equity (SDHE) Analysis

## Deep Analysis of Health Gaps Across Population Groups

---

## 5. RESULTS

### 5.1 Population Group Overview

Survey responses (N=6,523) were analyzed across five population groups:

- **General Population**: n=1,315 (20.2%)
- **Elderly (60+)**: n=2,986 (45.8%)
- **LGBT+ Community**: n=685 (10.5%)
- **People with Disabilities**: n=638 (9.8%)
- **Informal Workers**: n=2,645 (40.5%)

### 5.2 Significant Health Equity Gaps

Statistical analysis identified **138 significant differences** (p < 0.05) between the general population and priority groups across SDHE domains.

#### 5.2.1 Most Significant Health Disparities

The following table presents the 10 largest health equity gaps identified. All differences shown are statistically significant (p < 0.001).

**How to read this table**: The "Gap" column shows the percentage point difference between the population group and general population. For example, if general population has 10% hypertension and elderly have 76%, the gap is 66 percentage points. The p-value shows statistical significance (p < 0.001 = extremely strong evidence).

| # | Population Group | Health Indicator | SDHE Domain | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value | Direction |
|---|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Elderly | Employment contract | Employment & Income | 95.9% | 8.4% | **-87.5 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have employment contract |
| 2 | Informal Workers | Employment contract | Employment & Income | 95.9% | 0.0% | **-95.9 pp** | < 0.001 | Almost never have employment contract |
| 3 | Informal Workers | Occupation welfare | Employment & Income | 81.9% | 10.6% | **-71.3 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have occupation welfare |
| 4 | Elderly | Occupation welfare | Employment & Income | 81.9% | 8.8% | **-73.1 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have occupation welfare |
| 5 | Elderly | Hypertension | Chronic Diseases | 10.2% | 76.5% | **+66.4 pp** | < 0.001 | Much higher hypertension rate |
| 6 | Elderly | Has chronic disease | Chronic Diseases | 34.9% | 78.7% | **+43.8 pp** | < 0.001 | Much higher chronic disease rate |
| 7 | Informal Workers | Employed | Employment & Income | 78.9% | 100.0% | **+21.1 pp** | < 0.001 | More likely to be employed (by definition) |
| 8 | Elderly | Primary education or less | Education & Skills | 5.4% | 61.0% | **+55.6 pp** | < 0.001 | Much more likely to have only primary education |
| 9 | Elderly | Bachelor's degree or higher | Education & Skills | 52.2% | 9.8% | **-42.4 pp** | < 0.001 | Much less likely to have bachelor's degree |
| 10 | Disabled | Primary education or less | Education & Skills | 5.4% | 54.4% | **+49.0 pp** | < 0.001 | Much more likely to have only primary education |

**Key Findings**:
- **Employment protection**: Elderly and informal workers have dramatically lower rates of employment contracts and occupation welfare (71-96 percentage points lower)
- **Chronic diseases**: Elderly have 66 percentage points higher hypertension rate and 44 percentage points higher overall chronic disease burden
- **Education gaps**: Vulnerable groups are 31-56 percentage points MORE likely to have only primary education and 37-42 percentage points LESS likely to have bachelor's degrees compared to general population

**Note**: Education comparisons show the percentage of each group at different education levels (primary ≤ป.6, secondary ม.1-6, vocational ปวช./ปวส., bachelor+ ปริญญาตรีขึ้นไป). For example, 61% of elderly have only primary education vs 5.4% of general population.

#### 5.2.2 Gaps by SDHE Domain

Analysis of 138 significant health disparities across 8 SDHE domains reveals systematic inequities. Below are key findings by domain, showing how each population group differs from the general population.

**Employment & Income**: 25 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Informal Workers | Has employment contract | 95.9% | 0.0% | **+95.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has employment contract | 95.9% | 8.4% | **+87.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 8.8% | **+73.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 10.6% | **+71.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Employed | 92.6% | 39.9% | **+52.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has contract | 95.9% | 46.7% | **+49.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Has contract | 95.9% | 53.8% | **+42.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Employed | 92.6% | 52.2% | **+40.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | **-15,773 THB** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 20,252 THB | **-10,291 THB** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**The Contract Gap:** Virtually no informal workers (0.0%) have formal employment contracts compared to 95.9% of the general population - a 95.9 pp gap that represents complete exclusion from formal labor protections. Elderly workers show a similar pattern at just 8.4% contract coverage (87.5 pp gap). This data pattern is consistent with a segmented labor market where certain groups concentrate in work arrangements that provide no legal protections, though our survey cannot identify whether this results from employer discrimination, worker preference, or structural economic factors.

**The Welfare Cascade:** The survey data reveals a clear pattern linking contracts to welfare access. Among employed elderly, only 8.8% have occupation-based welfare; among informal workers, only 10.6% do - compared to 81.9% of the general employed population (gaps of 73.1 pp and 71.3 pp respectively). Among those without contracts in our sample, welfare coverage drops to near zero, suggesting that formal employment serves as the primary gateway to workplace benefits in Bangkok's economy.

**Income Disparities:** Employed elderly earn an average of 14,770 THB monthly compared to 30,543 THB for the general population - a difference of 15,773 THB or 52% less. Disabled individuals earn 20,252 THB (10,291 THB or 34% less). These income gaps are statistically associated with employment formality in our data: among employed elderly, those with formal contracts earn 20,581 THB versus 14,273 THB without contracts (6,308 THB gap, 44% more with contract, p < 0.0001). Educational attainment shows modest income associations: elderly with only primary education earn an average of 13,563 THB compared to 14,885 THB for those with higher education (1,322 THB gap, 10% difference), though this gap is substantially smaller than the contract-income relationship. The data pattern suggests that employment formality (contract status) has a stronger association with income than educational attainment among elderly workers, though our cross-sectional design cannot establish whether contracts cause higher income, or whether other factors (occupation type, employer characteristics, negotiation capacity) drive both contract access and income levels.

**Employment Exclusion:** Only 39.9% of disabled respondents report being employed, compared to 92.6% of the general population (52.7 pp gap). Elderly show 52.2% employment (40.4 pp gap). While the survey cannot identify the barriers preventing employment - whether physical accessibility, employer hiring practices, health limitations, or caregiving responsibilities - the magnitude of these gaps indicates substantial obstacles to labor force participation for these groups.

**Education & Skills**: 18 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 61.0% | **+55.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 53.6% | **+48.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Bachelor's degree or higher | 52.2% | 9.8% | **-42.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Primary education or less | 5.4% | 36.5% | **+31.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can do math | 99.6% | 80.6% | **+19.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has training | 28.7% | 9.7% | **+19.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can write | 99.4% | 81.0% | **+18.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Can read | 99.4% | 85.6% | **+13.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has training | 28.7% | 16.0% | **+12.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has training | 28.7% | 16.9% | **+11.8 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Educational Attainment Gaps:** Elderly respondents show 61.0% with only primary education compared to 5.4% in the general population - a 55.6 pp gap (p < 0.001). Disabled respondents have 53.6% with primary education, a 48.2 pp gap. Informal workers show 36.5% at primary level, a 31.1 pp difference. These educational gaps have dramatically different income implications across population groups, as shown in the table below:

| Population Group | Primary (≤ป.6) Income | Bachelor+ Income | Gap | Income Return | p-value | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disabled | 8,787 THB | 24,981 THB | **+16,194 THB** | **2.84× (184%)** | 0.003 | 152 |
| General | 13,000 THB | 31,363 THB | **+18,363 THB** | **2.41× (141%)** | 0.079 | 1,010 |
| Informal Workers | 13,900 THB | 25,557 THB | **+11,658 THB** | **1.84× (84%)** | < 0.001 | 2,048 |
| Elderly | 13,563 THB | 19,404 THB | **+5,841 THB** | **1.43× (43%)** | 0.002 | 863 |
| LGBT+ | 27,000 THB | 26,848 THB | **-152 THB** | **0.99× (0%)** | 0.993 | 458 |

**Education Returns Vary Dramatically by Group:** For disabled individuals, education shows the strongest income effect of all groups - Bachelor+ degree holders earn **2.84 times more** than those with only primary education (16,194 THB gap, p=0.003). Informal workers also show substantial education returns at 1.84× (11,658 THB gap, p < 0.001), demonstrating that education provides significant economic benefits even in the informal sector. In stark contrast, elderly workers show modest returns at 1.43× (5,841 THB gap), likely reflecting that many educated elderly are retired or semi-retired, compressing wage differences. Most strikingly, **LGBT+ individuals show zero education returns** - primary-educated and Bachelor+ LGBT+ earn virtually identical incomes (27,000 vs 26,848 THB, p=0.993), suggesting that discrimination or occupational segregation may eliminate the typical economic benefits of education for this group.

**Employment Formality as Income Mediator:** Among employed elderly, only 4.5% with low education have formal contracts compared to 20.1% with higher education (15.6 pp gap, p < 0.0001), and those with contracts earn 20,581 THB versus 14,273 THB without contracts (6,308 THB difference or 44% more, p < 0.0001). While these correlations are clear, our cross-sectional data cannot determine causality - whether education directly causes better employment outcomes, or whether both are influenced by other factors like family background, access to opportunities, or historical context. The data suggests that for elderly workers, contract status may mediate much of the relationship between education and income, while for disabled and informal workers, education maintains direct income effects even controlling for employment formality.

**Basic Literacy and Numeracy:** Among disabled respondents, 19.1 pp fewer report being able to do math (80.6% vs. 99.6% general), 18.4 pp fewer can write (81.0% vs. 99.4%), and 13.8 pp fewer can read (85.6% vs. 99.4%). These gaps are statistically significant (all p < 0.001). Cross-variable analysis reveals that education level strongly predicts literacy skills within the disabled population: among disabled with low education, only 73.4% can do math, 73.9% can write, and 79.5% can read, compared to 94.8%, 95.3%, and 97.7% respectively among disabled with higher education (gaps of 18-21 pp, all p < 0.0001, n=638). Critically, when comparing within education levels, the disability gap shrinks dramatically: among those with higher education, disabled respondents show only 4.9 pp lower math skills than the general population, versus 23.2 pp lower among those with low education. This suggests that educational attainment accounts for the majority of the observed literacy gap between disabled and general populations, though disability-specific factors still contribute even after controlling for education.

**Training Access Disparities:** Only 9.7% of disabled respondents report having training access compared to 28.7% of the general population (19.0 pp gap, p < 0.001). Similarly, elderly (16.0%) and informal workers (16.9%) show significantly lower training access than the general population. This pattern suggests that groups with lower baseline educational attainment also have reduced access to skill development opportunities, though the survey cannot determine whether this reflects program availability, awareness, physical accessibility, eligibility requirements, or other factors.

**Compound Disadvantages:** The data shows that the same groups with lower educational attainment (elderly, disabled, informal workers) also have substantially lower training access. This pattern is consistent with compounding barriers where initial educational disadvantage may be reinforced by limited access to adult skill development, though our cross-sectional survey cannot establish whether one causes the other or both stem from common underlying factors.

**Healthcare Access**: 6 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LGBT+ | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 43.6% | **+14.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 15.4% | **-13.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| General | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 31.4% | - | - |
| Disabled | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 25.5% | **-3.3 pp** | n.s. |
| Disabled | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 21.6% | **-9.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 21.7% | **-9.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 23.7% | **-5.2 pp** | n.s. |
| Informal Workers | Had oral health symptoms | 31.4% | 24.9% | **-6.5 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Note on Universal Health Coverage**: Thailand's universal health coverage system means that nearly all survey respondents have some form of health coverage. The survey shows 65.2% with universal coverage (30 baht scheme/บัตรทอง), 23.8% with social security, 8.1% with civil servant welfare, and 2.9% with other coverage. This high baseline coverage means that healthcare access barriers observed in vulnerable populations reflect factors beyond insurance status - including out-of-pocket costs not covered by schemes, service accessibility, fear of discrimination, transportation barriers, or time constraints.

**Cost-Related Care Avoidance - LGBT+ Population at Highest Risk:** Despite universal health coverage, LGBT+ respondents show dramatically elevated rates of skipping medical care due to cost: 43.6% report skipping care in the past 12 months compared to 28.9% of the general population (14.8 pp gap, p < 0.001). This represents the highest medical care skipping rate among all population groups surveyed. Conversely, elderly show lower skipping rates at 15.4% (13.5 pp gap, p < 0.001), while disabled (25.5%, n.s.) and informal workers (23.7%, n.s.) show no statistically significant differences from the general population.

**Income as a Barrier Within Vulnerable Groups:** Cross-variable analysis reveals that income is the strongest predictor of healthcare access within vulnerable populations, even when controlling for group membership. The table below shows medical care skipping rates stratified by monthly income level within each vulnerable group (daily income converted to monthly equivalent assuming 30 working days):

| Population Group | Low Income (<10K THB/month) | Higher Income (≥10K THB/month) | Gap | p-value | Sample Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disabled | **61.1% skip care** | 23.4% skip care | **37.7 pp** | < 0.001 | n=638 |
| Elderly | **43.6% skip care** | 12.7% skip care | **30.9 pp** | < 0.001 | n=2,986 |
| Informal Workers | **49.4% skip care** | 18.7% skip care | **30.7 pp** | < 0.001 | n=2,645 |
| LGBT+ | **62.5% skip care** | 42.7% skip care | **19.8 pp** | 0.043 | n=685 |

**Key Finding:** Low-income vulnerable populations face catastrophically high medical care skipping rates. **More than 60% of low-income disabled and LGBT+ individuals** skip medical care due to cost - meaning these groups are more likely to forego care than to receive it. Among low-income elderly (43.6%) and informal workers (49.4%), nearly half skip necessary medical care. Income disparities within vulnerable groups are massive: low-income disabled skip care at **2.6 times the rate** of higher-income disabled (61.1% vs 23.4%), and low-income elderly at **3.4 times the rate** of higher-income elderly (43.6% vs 12.7%). This pattern reveals that economic barriers compound healthcare access disparities even in a universal coverage system, with out-of-pocket costs (medications, transportation, income loss from taking time off work) creating catastrophic barriers for low-income individuals despite having health insurance. The intersection of vulnerability status and poverty creates a healthcare access crisis where the majority of the poorest disabled and LGBT+ individuals cannot afford to seek care when needed.

**Employment Formality and Healthcare Access:** Counterintuitively, formal workers show *higher* medical care skipping rates (32.6%) compared to informal workers (23.7%) and non-employed individuals (16.9%). However, when examining the interaction between income and employment, low-income formal workers show the highest skipping rate (44.3%), suggesting that formal employment alone does not guarantee healthcare access when income is insufficient to cover out-of-pocket costs.

**Oral Health Access Barriers - Distinct Profiles Across Groups:** Analysis of reasons for not accessing oral health care reveals fundamentally different barrier profiles across population groups, as shown in the table below:

**Table: Oral Health Access Barriers by Population Group**

| Group | Did Not Access | Non-Access Rate | Cost | Fear | No Time | Self-Treatment | Wait Time | Distance | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **General** | n=156 | **11.9%** | 32.7% | **33.3%** | 23.1% | 3.2% | 3.8% | 0.0% | 3.8% |
| **LGBT+** | n=103 | **15.0%** | 32.0% | 22.3% | **34.0%** | 3.9% | 3.9% | 0.0% | 3.9% |
| **Disabled** | n=78 | 12.2% | 26.9% | 7.7% | 10.3% | 16.7% | 15.4% | 3.8% | 19.2% |
| **Informal** | n=255 | 9.6% | 26.7% | 14.1% | 14.5% | **22.4%** | 6.7% | 1.6% | 14.1% |
| **Elderly** | n=226 | 7.6% | 15.5% | 5.8% | 4.0% | **34.5%** | 13.7% | 3.5% | 23.0% |

*Note: Percentages show the proportion of each reason among those who did not access oral health care. Non-access rate is the percentage of the total group who did not access care when needed.*

**Distinct Barrier Patterns by Group:**

- **General Population**: Balanced between **fear (33.3%)** and **cost (32.7%)** as primary barriers, with moderate time constraints (23.1%). This represents "typical" healthcare-seeking barriers.

- **LGBT+**: Highest non-access rate (15.0%) with **"no time" dominating (34.0%)**, suggesting employment precarity or time poverty. Cost (32.0%) and fear (22.3%) also significant, indicating triple barriers.

- **Elderly**: Lowest non-access rate (7.6%) but dramatically different response - **self-treatment dominates (34.5%)**, 31.3 pp higher than general population. Very low fear (5.8%) and cost (15.5%) barriers suggest they don't view dental care as necessary, instead normalizing poor oral health ("ซื้อยากินเอง" - buy medicine myself, "ฟันหลุดออกเอง" - teeth fell out by themselves).

- **Informal Workers**: Moderate non-access rate (9.6%) with **self-treatment (22.4%)** as second-highest barrier after cost (26.7%), suggesting economic constraints lead to self-medication rather than professional care.

- **Disabled**: Mixed barrier profile with **self-treatment (16.7%)**, **wait time (15.4%)**, and **other reasons (19.2%)** suggesting accessibility issues beyond standard barriers. Low fear (7.7%) may reflect necessity overriding anxiety.

**Key Finding**: The **34.5% self-treatment rate among elderly** (vs 3.2% general) indicates they respond to oral health problems by buying medicine themselves, using herbal remedies, or waiting for symptoms to resolve rather than seeking professional dental care. This self-treatment pattern, combined with lower fear rates (5.8% vs 33.3% general) and higher acceptance of tooth loss, suggests normalization of poor oral health as part of aging rather than true barriers to access.

**Oral Health Status Disparities:** Counterintuitively, vulnerable groups report **lower** rates of oral health symptoms in the past 12 months compared to the general population: disabled (21.6%), elderly (21.7%), and informal workers (24.9%) versus general population (31.4%), with gaps ranging from 6.5 to 9.8 pp (all p < 0.001). This unexpected pattern may reflect **underreporting** rather than genuinely better oral health - vulnerable groups may normalize dental problems, lack awareness of symptoms, or perceive minor issues as not worth reporting. This interpretation is supported by the high self-treatment rates documented earlier (elderly 34.5%, informal 22.4%), suggesting these groups experience oral health problems but respond through self-medication rather than formal care-seeking, potentially not recognizing or reporting these as "symptoms" warranting professional attention. The combination of lower reported symptoms yet high self-treatment and access barriers indicates that vulnerable populations may have poor oral health that goes unrecognized or unreported, rather than genuinely better oral health status.

**Healthcare Access as Economic Vulnerability Indicator:** Healthcare access patterns - both general medical care and oral health - reveal the complex interplay of economic vulnerability, behavioral adaptation, and systemic barriers facing vulnerable populations in Bangkok.

**Medical Care Skipping:** Even with universal health insurance, out-of-pocket costs create catastrophic barriers, with effects most pronounced among low-income disabled (61.1% skipping), low-income LGBT+ (62.5%), low-income informal workers (49.4%), and low-income elderly (43.6%). The magnitude of these rates - with majorities of the poorest disabled and LGBT+ unable to access care when needed - demonstrates that universal coverage alone cannot eliminate economic barriers to healthcare.

**Oral Health:** The oral health data reveals a different pattern - vulnerable groups report fewer symptoms (elderly 21.7%, disabled 21.6%, informal 24.9% vs general 31.4%), yet show dramatically higher self-treatment rates (elderly 34.5%, informal 22.4% vs general 3.2%). This paradox suggests normalization and underreporting rather than better health, with vulnerable groups managing dental problems through self-medication rather than recognizing them as symptoms warranting professional care.

**Dual Barriers for LGBT+:** LGBT+ individuals face compounded challenges - the highest medical care skipping rate (43.6% overall, 62.5% for low-income), highest oral health non-access rate (15.0%), and unique barriers including time poverty (34.0% cite "no time") and fear (22.3%). Additionally, LGBT+ show zero economic returns to education (0.99× income multiplier), suggesting that discrimination or occupational segregation eliminates both healthcare access and the typical economic benefits of educational investment.

**Behavioral Adaptation vs Access Barriers:** The contrast between medical care (where vulnerable groups seek care but cannot afford it) and oral health (where they normalize problems and self-treat) illustrates how populations adapt to systemic barriers. When professional care is perceived as unaffordable or unnecessary, vulnerable groups develop alternative coping strategies - self-treatment, symptom normalization, and acceptance of deteriorating health - that may mask the true burden of poor health status in survey data.

**Chronic Diseases**: 14 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Hypertension | 10.2% | 76.5% | **-66.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Hypertension | 10.2% | 56.4% | **-46.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 78.7% | **-43.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 76.6% | **-41.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Hypertension | 10.2% | 49.7% | **-39.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Diabetes | 8.1% | 43.0% | **-34.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Diabetes | 8.1% | 33.4% | **-25.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Diabetes | 8.1% | 27.7% | **-19.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Has any chronic disease | 34.9% | 51.2% | **-16.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Kidney disease | 0.7% | 3.6% | **-2.9 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Substantial Age-Related Disparities:** Elderly respondents show dramatically elevated chronic disease rates: 76.5% report hypertension compared to 10.2% general population (66.4 pp gap, p < 0.001), 43.0% have diabetes versus 8.1% general (34.9 pp gap), and 78.7% report any chronic disease versus 34.9% general (43.8 pp gap). These large gaps are statistically significant and represent substantially higher disease burden among elderly respondents in our survey.

**Disabled Population Disease Burden:** Disabled respondents show similarly elevated rates: 56.4% hypertension (46.3 pp gap), 33.4% diabetes (25.3 pp gap), 76.6% any chronic disease (41.7 pp gap), and 3.6% kidney disease (2.9 pp gap) - all significantly higher than general population (p < 0.001). The survey captures these associations but cannot determine directionality - whether disability status increases chronic disease risk, chronic diseases lead to disability, or both conditions share common underlying factors.

**Informal Worker Health Patterns:** Informal workers report 49.7% hypertension (39.5 pp gap), 27.7% diabetes (19.6 pp gap), and 51.2% any chronic disease (16.3 pp gap) - all significantly elevated compared to general population (p < 0.001). These disparities are consistent with informal employment being associated with poorer health outcomes, though our cross-sectional data cannot establish whether informal work contributes to disease development, health conditions push workers into informal sector, or both groups share other risk factors (age, education, income) not fully controlled in this analysis.

**Disease Concentration in Vulnerable Groups:** The data shows that the same groups (elderly, disabled, informal workers) have elevated rates across multiple chronic conditions - hypertension, diabetes, and overall chronic disease. This pattern suggests clustering of chronic diseases within certain populations, which could reflect shared risk factors, compounding health disadvantages, or comorbidity effects, though our survey design does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities.

**Health Behaviors**: 15 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |

| Elderly | Drinking | 82.1% | 49.1% | **+33.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Exercise | 107.6% | 80.2% | **+27.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Exercise | 107.6% | 84.6% | **+23.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Drinking | 82.1% | 62.5% | **+19.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Drinking | 82.1% | 63.4% | **+18.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Smoking | 86.6% | 69.3% | **+17.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | BMI overweight | 46.2% | 36.5% | **+9.7 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Substance Use Patterns:** Elderly and disabled respondents report substantially lower rates of smoking and drinking compared to the general population. Elderly show 36.9% smoking versus 86.6% general (49.7 pp gap, p < 0.001) and 49.1% drinking versus 82.1% general (33.1 pp gap). Disabled respondents show 52.0% smoking (34.6 pp gap) and 62.5% drinking (19.6 pp gap). Informal workers also report lower rates at 69.3% smoking (17.4 pp gap) and 63.4% drinking (18.7 pp gap). While these gaps might initially appear favorable, the survey does not capture the reasons behind these patterns - whether they reflect health-motivated choices, economic constraints, social isolation, medication interactions, or other factors - limiting interpretation of their health significance.

**Exercise Disparities:** Disabled respondents report 54.5% exercise engagement compared to 107.6% general population (53.1 pp gap, p < 0.001). Note that the general population rate exceeds 100%, suggesting the survey methodology allows reporting multiple forms of exercise or exercise frequency that sums above 100%. Elderly (80.2%, 27.4 pp gap) and informal workers (84.6%, 23.0 pp gap) also show significantly lower exercise rates. Cross-variable analysis reveals a bidirectional relationship between chronic disease and exercise: among disabled respondents, those with chronic diseases exercise 16.2 pp less than those without (54.5% vs. 70.7%, p < 0.001, n=638). Among elderly, chronic disease correlates with 10.1 pp less exercise (76.7% vs. 86.8%, p < 0.001, n=2,986). While the causal direction cannot be determined from cross-sectional data - whether disease reduces exercise or lack of exercise increases disease risk - this association suggests a potential feedback loop where chronic disease and physical inactivity reinforce each other.

**Body Weight Differences:** Disabled respondents show 9.7 pp lower overweight rates (36.5%) compared to the general population (46.2%), p < 0.001. This difference is statistically significant but counterintuitive given lower exercise rates in this group. The survey does not capture information about diet, metabolism, medication effects, or other factors that might explain this pattern, making causal interpretation difficult.

**Survey Limitations:** The health behavior indicators capture smoking, drinking, exercise, and BMI, but do not include measures of mental health, sleep quality, stress levels, dietary patterns, or other behavioral health domains that may be equally or more relevant for understanding health disparities in vulnerable populations.

**Housing & Environment**: 14 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Own house | 25.2% | 48.5% | **-23.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Rent house | 44.9% | 24.2% | **+20.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 42.7% | **+19.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Rent house | 44.9% | 28.8% | **+16.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 49.8% | **+12.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Health problems from pollution | 62.3% | 50.2% | **+12.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Experienced disaster | 2.5% | 14.5% | **-12.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Own house | 25.2% | 14.9% | **+10.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Experienced disaster | 2.5% | 11.4% | **-8.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Rent house | 44.9% | 53.1% | **-8.2 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Housing Tenure Patterns:** Elderly respondents show 48.5% homeownership compared to 25.2% general population (23.4 pp higher, p < 0.001) and 24.2% renting compared to 44.9% general (20.7 pp lower, p < 0.001). Conversely, LGBT+ respondents show 14.9% homeownership (10.3 pp lower) and 53.1% renting (8.2 pp higher). Disabled respondents show 28.8% renting (16.1 pp lower than general population). These patterns indicate substantial differences in housing tenure across groups, though the survey does not capture other housing arrangements (living with family, institutional housing, informal arrangements) that would complete the housing picture.

**Pollution-Related Health Problems:** The survey shows a counterintuitive pattern: elderly (42.7%), disabled (50.2%), and informal workers (49.8%) report *lower* rates of pollution-related health problems compared to the general population (62.3%), with gaps of 12.1-19.5 pp (all p < 0.001). This pattern is unexpected and difficult to interpret. Possible explanations include differences in pollution exposure, differences in awareness or attribution of health problems to pollution, health reporting patterns, or residential location differences, though our survey data cannot distinguish between these possibilities.

**Disaster Exposure:** Disabled (14.5%) and elderly (11.4%) respondents report significantly higher rates of experiencing disasters compared to the general population (2.5%), with gaps of 8.9-12.1 pp (both p < 0.001). These substantial differences suggest that certain population groups may live in more disaster-prone areas or have greater vulnerability to disaster impacts, though the survey question does not specify disaster type (flooding, fire, building collapse, etc.) or whether exposure differences reflect residential location, housing quality, evacuation capacity, or other factors.

**Data Gaps:** Housing tenure categories (own/rent) do not sum to 100%, indicating that many respondents fall into other housing arrangements not captured by these binary measures. The survey also does not include indicators of housing quality, overcrowding, safety, affordability burden, or accessibility features that would provide a more complete picture of housing conditions across population groups.

**Violence & Safety**: 18 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 3.6% | **+13.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 29.2% | **-12.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 7.3% | **+9.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Psychological violence | 17.2% | 8.2% | **+9.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Physical violence | 6.1% | 13.1% | **-7.1 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Physical violence | 6.1% | 0.7% | **+5.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Physical violence | 6.1% | 2.4% | **+3.7 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Physical violence | 6.1% | 2.7% | **+3.4 pp** | 0.002 |
| Elderly | Discrimination | 3.7% | 1.1% | **+2.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Discrimination | 3.7% | 6.3% | **-2.6 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Contrasting Violence Patterns by Group:** LGBT+ respondents report substantially higher rates of both psychological violence (29.2% vs. 17.2% general, 12.0 pp gap, p < 0.001) and physical violence (13.1% vs. 6.1% general, 7.1 pp gap, p < 0.001). Conversely, elderly, informal workers, and disabled respondents report *lower* rates of both psychological (3.6%, 7.3%, 8.2% respectively) and physical violence (0.7%, 2.4%, 2.7% respectively) compared to the general population. These divergent patterns suggest that violence exposure differs substantially across vulnerable groups, though our survey does not capture the contexts, perpetrators, or types of violence that might explain these differences.

**Discrimination Reporting:** LGBT+ respondents report 6.3% discrimination versus 3.7% general population (2.6 pp gap, p < 0.001). Elderly report 1.1% discrimination (2.6 pp lower than general). Notably, disabled respondents are not shown in this table despite often facing discrimination. These relatively low absolute percentages across all groups raise questions about whether the survey question captures the full scope of discriminatory experiences, or whether certain forms of discrimination (subtle bias, institutional barriers, microaggressions) are not recognized or reported as "discrimination" by respondents.

**Reporting Limitations:** Violence and discrimination data rely on self-reported experiences, which may be influenced by multiple factors: recognition of behavior as violence/discrimination, willingness to disclose, recall period, cultural norms about what constitutes violence, and survey question wording. The survey does not capture information about perpetrators (family, strangers, institutions, state actors), settings (home, workplace, public spaces), severity, frequency, or impacts of violence and discrimination, limiting our ability to interpret patterns.

**Missing Indicators:** The survey captures interpersonal violence and discrimination but does not include measures of institutional violence, police encounters, harassment in healthcare or social services, housing discrimination, or other forms of systematic mistreatment that may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

**Family & Household**: 10 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Children in household | 64.0% | 12.3% | **+51.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Workers in household | 2.6 persons | 2.2 persons | **+0.4 persons** | < 0.001 |
| Disabled | Children in household | 64.0% | 21.8% | **+42.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Children in household | 64.0% | 30.2% | **+33.8 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Married | 36.9% | 12.0% | **+24.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Household size | 3.9 persons | 3.7 persons | **+0.2 persons** | 0.006 |
| Informal Workers | Household size | 3.9 persons | 3.7 persons | **+0.2 persons** | 0.009 |
| Disabled | Married | 36.9% | 27.0% | **+9.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Married | 36.9% | 40.4% | **-3.5 pp** | 0.031 |
| Elderly | Elderly in household | 1.0 persons | 3.9 persons | **-2.9 persons** | 0.012 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Household Composition Differences:** Elderly respondents show dramatically lower presence of children in households (12.3% vs. 64.0% general, 51.8 pp gap, p < 0.001), as do disabled (21.8%, 42.2 pp gap) and informal worker (30.2%, 33.8 pp gap) respondents. These substantial gaps reflect differences in household composition across groups, which could indicate life stage differences (elderly with adult children living separately), family formation patterns, or living arrangements, though the survey does not capture household relationship structures or reasons for composition patterns.

**Marriage Rates:** LGBT+ (12.0%) and disabled (27.0%) respondents report significantly lower marriage rates compared to the general population (36.9%), with gaps of 24.9 pp and 9.9 pp respectively (both p < 0.001). Elderly show 3.5 pp higher marriage rate (40.4%, p = 0.031). These differences are statistically significant, though the survey does not distinguish between never married, divorced, widowed, or partnered but not married, nor does it capture same-sex partnerships that may not be legally recognized or reported as "marriage."

**Household Size and Workers:** Elderly and informal worker households average 3.7 persons compared to 3.9 general population (0.2 person gap, p < 0.01 for both). Elderly households have 2.2 workers versus 2.6 general (0.4 worker gap, p < 0.001). These modest but significant differences suggest slight variations in household structure and economic composition across groups.

**Elderly Household Concentration:** Elderly respondents report 3.9 elderly persons per household compared to 1.0 in general population (2.9 person gap, p = 0.012). This substantial difference indicates that elderly respondents are more likely to live in households with multiple elderly members, which could reflect couples aging together, siblings cohabiting, or elderly parents living with elderly children, though our survey does not provide relationship data to clarify household composition.

**Food Security**: 6 significant disparities found

| Population Group | Indicator | General Pop. | This Group | Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elderly | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 4.7% | **+9.0 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 7.2% | **+6.5 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Food insecurity worry | 13.7% | 20.0% | **-6.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| LGBT+ | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 13.0% | **-5.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Elderly | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 3.2% | **+4.4 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Informal Workers | Food insecurity skip meals | 7.6% | 4.6% | **+3.0 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Divergent Food Security Patterns:** The data shows contrasting patterns across groups. Elderly and informal workers report *lower* rates of food insecurity worry (4.7% and 7.2% vs. 13.7% general) and meal skipping (3.2% and 4.6% vs. 7.6% general), with gaps of 3.0-9.0 pp (all p < 0.001). Conversely, LGBT+ respondents report *higher* rates of food worry (20.0%, 6.3 pp gap, p < 0.001) and meal skipping (13.0%, 5.4 pp gap, p < 0.001). These patterns are statistically significant but somewhat counterintuitive given the income disparities documented earlier for elderly and informal workers.

**Interpretation Challenges:** The lower food insecurity rates among elderly and informal workers, despite their documented lower incomes, raise interpretive questions. Cross-variable analysis reveals a paradoxical relationship between income and food insecurity among informal workers: 16.9% of higher-income informal workers (>10,000 THB/month) report food insecurity compared to only 8.3% of lower-income informal workers (8.6 pp gap, p < 0.001, n=2,048). This counterintuitive pattern suggests that income volatility rather than income level may drive food insecurity in this population - higher earners in informal work may experience greater income fluctuations, making food security episodic rather than constant. This finding challenges simple income-based interventions and suggests that income stability may matter more than income amount for food security among informal workers. However, our survey's cross-sectional design cannot confirm this volatility hypothesis.

**Survey Measurement Limitations:** The food security indicators capture worry about food and meal skipping, but do not measure food quality, nutritional adequacy, dietary diversity, caloric intake, or specific barriers to food access. The survey also does not specify the time period for reporting (past week, month, year), which may affect responses, particularly for groups with volatile income patterns. Additionally, the questions do not distinguish between having insufficient food quantity versus insufficient resources to obtain preferred quality or variety of food.

**Missing Context:** The survey does not capture information about food assistance programs, household food sharing arrangements, informal support networks, food environment characteristics (availability and pricing in neighborhoods), or the relationship between food insecurity and the chronic disease patterns observed earlier in the analysis. These contextual factors would help interpret the observed disparities.

### 5.3 Geographic Health Disparities

Comparison of top 5 performing districts versus bottom 5 districts revealed systematic disparities across 19 health indicators. These geographic inequities exist independent of individual characteristics, suggesting that place of residence significantly impacts health outcomes in Bangkok.

**Key District-Level Disparities**:
- *health_pollution*: 29.8% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *education_level*: 1.2% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *own_house*: 26.3% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *experienced_disaster*: 9.0% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *exercise*: 32.6% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *has_welfare*: 22.0% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *smoking*: 30.7% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *has_training*: 8.6% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *drinking*: 14.7% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)
- *working_hours*: 55.9% difference between best and worst performing districts (p=0.000)

### 5.4 Intersection Group Analysis

Analysis of individuals with multiple marginalized identities reveals how vulnerabilities compound beyond simple addition. The following tables show key health equity indicators for intersection groups compared to the general population.

**Elderly + Disabled** (n=39)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Elderly Only | Disabled Only | Elderly + Disabled | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | 20,252 THB | **10,645 THB** | **-19,898 THB (-65.1%)** | < 0.001 |
| Employment rate | 92.6% | 52.2% | 39.9% | **33.3%** | **-59.3 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 8.8% | 46.7% | **-** | **-** | - |
| Food insecurity | 13.7% | 4.7% | - | **7.9%** | **-5.8 pp** | 0.003 |
| Violence exposure | 17.2% | 3.6% | 8.2% | **11.9%** | **-5.3 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Compounding Economic Vulnerability:** Elderly individuals with disabilities face the most severe economic disadvantage of all intersection groups. Their average monthly income of 10,645 THB is 65.1% lower than the general population (19,898 THB gap) and 28.9% lower than elderly without disabilities (4,321 THB gap, p < 0.001). Only 33.3% are employed compared to 52.2% of elderly without disabilities (18.9 pp gap) and 39.9% of non-elderly disabled (6.6 pp gap). This dual burden creates a multiplicative rather than additive effect - being both elderly AND disabled compounds employment barriers beyond what either identity alone predicts.

**Paradoxical Food Security:** Surprisingly, elderly+disabled show lower food insecurity (7.9%) than the general population (13.7%), despite having the lowest incomes. This 5.8 pp gap (p=0.003) mirrors the pattern observed for elderly-only populations and likely reflects similar factors: potential access to targeted food assistance programs, lower household size reducing food needs, or different reporting thresholds for what constitutes food insecurity.

**Violence and Discrimination:** Elderly+disabled report 11.9% violence exposure, which is lower than general population (17.2%, 5.3 pp gap, p < 0.001) but notably higher than elderly-only (3.6%) or disabled-only (8.2%) groups. This suggests that while age may provide some protection from violence, disability status increases vulnerability even among elderly populations.

**Elderly + Informal Workers** (n=795)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Elderly Only | Informal Only | Elderly + Informal | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | 23,922 THB | **14,273 THB** | **-16,270 THB (-53.3%)** | < 0.001 |
| Working hours/week | 48.0 hours | - | 48.0 hours | **8.2 hours** | **-39.8 hours (-82.8%)** | < 0.001 |
| Has employment contract | 95.9% | 8.4% | 0.0% | **0.0%** | **-95.9 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Has occupation welfare | 81.9% | 8.8% | 10.6% | **8.7%** | **-73.2 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Occupation injury | 1.3% | - | 3.2% | **1.3%** | **0.0 pp** | n.s. |
| Food insecurity | 13.7% | 4.7% | 7.2% | **4.1%** | **-9.6 pp** | < 0.001 |
| Violence exposure | 17.2% | 3.6% | 7.3% | **11.6%** | **-5.6 pp** | < 0.001 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**The Informal Elderly: Semi-Retirement in Precarity:** Elderly informal workers represent a distinct pattern of semi-retirement characterized by dramatically reduced working hours (8.2 hours/week compared to 48.0 for non-elderly informal workers, 82.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Despite working only 8 hours weekly, they earn 14,273 THB monthly - nearly identical to elderly-only average (14,770 THB), suggesting income sources beyond wages (pensions, savings, family support). However, their informal status means zero contract coverage (0.0%) and minimal welfare access (8.7%), leaving them without formal protections during their working years.

**No Additional Employment Protection Deficit:** Both informal-only (0.0%) and elderly+informal (0.0%) show zero contract coverage, meaning the intersection creates no additional gap beyond informal status alone. Similarly, occupation welfare rates are nearly identical (10.6% informal-only vs 8.7% elderly+informal), indicating that informal employment is the dominant factor determining employment protections, with age playing minimal additional role.

**Injury Risk Normalization:** Elderly+informal workers show 1.3% occupation injury rates, significantly lower than informal-only (3.2%, 1.9 pp gap, p=0.049). This likely reflects reduced working hours (82.8% less) proportionally reducing injury exposure rather than safer work conditions. The low absolute injury rate despite informal employment suggests that elderly individuals select less physically demanding informal work or that injury reporting decreases with age.

---

**Elderly + LGBT+** (n=11)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Elderly Only | LGBT+ Only | Elderly + LGBT+ | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 14,770 THB | 26,848 THB | **18,803 THB** | **-11,740 THB (-38.4%)** | 0.016 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Limited Statistical Power:** With only 11 respondents, this intersection group has insufficient sample size for robust statistical analysis across multiple indicators. Only income shows statistical significance.

**Income Patterns:** Elderly+LGBT+ earn 18,803 THB monthly, which is 38.4% lower than general population (11,740 THB gap, p=0.016). Notably, their income (18,803 THB) falls between elderly-only (14,770 THB) and LGBT+-only (26,848 THB), suggesting that LGBT+ identity may partially buffer against age-related income decline, or that elderly LGBT+ individuals represent a selected population with different socioeconomic characteristics than either group alone. However, the small sample size prevents definitive interpretation.

---

**Disabled + Informal Workers** (n=77)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Disabled Only | Informal Only | Disabled + Informal | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 20,252 THB | 23,922 THB | **15,030 THB** | **-15,513 THB (-50.8%)** | < 0.001 |
| Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 25.5% | 23.7% | **41.7%** | **+12.8 pp** | 0.003 |
| Violence exposure | 17.2% | 8.2% | 7.3% | **11.1%** | **-6.1 pp** | 0.008 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Compounded Healthcare Access Barriers:** Disabled+informal workers face the highest medical care skipping rate (41.7%) among disability intersections - significantly higher than disabled-only (25.5%, 16.2 pp gap) or informal-only (23.7%, 18.0 pp gap), and 12.8 pp higher than general population (p=0.003). This multiplicative effect demonstrates that informal employment compounds disability-related healthcare access barriers. While disabled individuals with formal employment may have occupation-based health benefits or more stable incomes to cover out-of-pocket costs, disabled informal workers face dual disadvantages: no employer health support AND income precarity.

**Income Penalty:** At 15,030 THB monthly, disabled+informal workers earn 50.8% less than general population (15,513 THB gap, p < 0.001). This represents a larger income deficit than either disabled-only (33.7% lower) or informal-only (21.7% lower), indicating compounding effects. The intersection creates additional economic vulnerability beyond single-identity predictions.

**Violence Patterns:** Like other intersections involving disability, disabled+informal workers show lower violence exposure (11.1%) than general population (17.2%, 6.1 pp gap, p=0.008), yet higher than single-identity groups (disabled 8.2%, informal 7.3%). This may reflect social isolation reducing overall conflict exposure.

---

**Disabled + LGBT+** (n=29)

| Indicator | General Pop. | Disabled Only | LGBT+ Only | Disabled + LGBT+ | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discrimination | 3.7% | - | 6.3% | **13.8%** | **+10.1 pp** | 0.025 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Extreme Discrimination Exposure:** Disabled+LGBT+ individuals report 13.8% discrimination - dramatically higher than either disabled-only or LGBT+-only populations (6.3%). This 10.1 pp gap compared to general population (p=0.025) represents more than double the LGBT+-only discrimination rate, suggesting that the intersection of disability and LGBT+ identity creates particularly severe discrimination experiences. This multiplicative effect indicates that individuals with both identities face discrimination contexts that neither group experiences in isolation.

**Sample Size Limitations:** With only 29 respondents, statistical power is limited. Only discrimination shows significance, though other indicators (healthcare access, income, violence) likely differ but cannot be detected with this sample size.

---

**LGBT+ + Informal Workers** (n=172)

| Indicator | General Pop. | LGBT+ Only | Informal Only | LGBT+ + Informal | Compounded Gap | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly income | 30,543 THB | 26,848 THB | 23,922 THB | **21,509 THB** | **-9,034 THB (-29.6%)** | < 0.001 |
| Skipped medical care (cost) | 28.9% | 43.6% | 23.7% | **34.7%** | **+5.8 pp** | 0.036 |

*What the numbers reveal:*

**Intersecting Economic Vulnerabilities:** LGBT++informal workers earn 21,509 THB monthly, 29.6% lower than general population (9,034 THB gap, p < 0.001). This is lower than LGBT+-only (26,848 THB, 19.9% gap) and informal-only (23,922 THB, 11.6% gap), showing additive income penalties. The intersection suggests that LGBT+ individuals who work informally may face compounded barriers in accessing better-paying formal employment - potentially due to discrimination limiting formal sector opportunities.

**Healthcare Access:** LGBT++informal show 34.7% medical care skipping, 5.8 pp higher than general population (p=0.036). Interestingly, this rate (34.7%) is lower than LGBT+-only (43.6%), suggesting that informal employment may not compound healthcare access barriers as severely for LGBT+ individuals as for disabled individuals. However, the rate remains substantially higher than informal-only (23.7%), indicating that LGBT+ identity is the dominant driver of healthcare access challenges in this intersection.

---

**Key Intersection Findings:**

**Multiplicative vs Additive Effects:** Different intersections show different compounding patterns. Healthcare access barriers multiply (disabled+informal: 41.7% skipping vs 25.5% disabled-only and 23.7% informal-only), while employment protections show floor effects (elderly+informal: 0.0% contracts, same as informal-only). Income penalties tend to be additive or slightly multiplicative across most intersections.

**Small Sample Challenges:** Several intersections (elderly+LGBT+ n=11, disabled+LGBT+ n=29) have insufficient statistical power for comprehensive analysis, limiting our ability to detect real disparities or generalize findings. Larger sample sizes would be needed to characterize these intersections definitively.

**Priority Intersections for Intervention:** Based on severity and sample size, three intersections warrant targeted policy attention:
1. **Elderly+Disabled (n=39)**: Most severe income deficit (-65.1%), lowest employment (33.3%)
2. **Disabled+Informal (n=77)**: Highest healthcare access barriers (41.7% skip care)
3. **Disabled+LGBT+ (n=29)**: Extreme discrimination exposure (13.8%)

### 5.5 Key Findings Summary

1. **Multiple Marginalization**: Individuals with intersecting marginalized identities experience compounded health disadvantages across multiple SDHE domains.

2. **Geographic Inequity**: Substantial variation in health outcomes exists across Bangkok districts, independent of individual-level characteristics.

3. **Systematic Disadvantage**: Priority population groups (elderly, LGBT+, disabled, informal workers) face consistent barriers across healthcare access, economic security, and social determinants.

4. **Intersectional Vulnerability**: Combined identities (e.g., elderly + disabled) show significantly worse outcomes than single-identity groups.

5. **Within-Group Stratification**: Significant disparities exist within vulnerable populations based on education, housing, employment, and income - highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

**Note**: All comparisons use chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for proportions, and independent t-tests for continuous variables. Effect sizes are reported using Cohen's h for proportions and Cohen's d for means. Statistical significance set at α = 0.05

**Interpretation of p-values**: A p-value of 0.000 shown in this report indicates p < 0.0005 (rounded to 0.000 when displayed to 3 decimal places), representing extremely high statistical significance. This means the probability that the observed difference occurred by random chance is less than 0.05%, or we can be more than 99.95% confident that the difference is real. This aligns with the methodology described in Section 3.2, which sets the significance threshold at α = 0.05 (p < 0.05 = statistically significant).
