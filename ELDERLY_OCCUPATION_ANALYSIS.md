## 1. Employment Status

### Current Employment at Age 72.4

| Employment Status | Count | Percentage |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| **Currently employed** | 1,147 | **38.4%** |
| **Not employed** | 1,839 | **61.6%** |
| **Total** | 2,986 | 100% |

**Key Finding**: Nearly 4 in 10 elderly (38.4%) still work at average age 72.4 years.

---

### Employment Status × Chronic Disease ✅ HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT

| Employment | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Employed | **71.1%** | n=1,147 |
| Unemployed | **83.5%** | n=1,839 |
| **Gap** | **-12.5pp** | — |
| **p-value** | **p<0.000001 ✅✅✅** | — |

**Interpretation**: Employed elderly have 12.5pp LESS chronic disease than unemployed elderly (p<0.000001, highly significant).

**Important**: Temporal direction unclear - possible explanations:
1. Healthier elderly can continue working
2. Work keeps elderly healthier (activity, social connection)
3. Selection bias (sick elderly stop working)

Mechanisms unknown (causality not tested).

### Reasons for Not Working (among unemployed elderly)

| Reason | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Cannot find work (unemployed/retired)** | 1,131 | **61.5%** |
| **Cannot work due to illness/disability** | 599 | **32.6%** |
| **Currently studying** | 1 | 0.1% |
| **Missing/Unknown** | 108 | 5.9% |
| **Total unemployed** | 1,839 | 100% |

**Key Pattern**: 32.6% cannot work due to illness/disability, suggesting poor health is a barrier to employment in retirement.

## 2. Occupation Types (Among Employed Elderly)

### Distribution

| Occupation Type | Count | Percentage | Average Income | Disease Rate |
|----------------|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Informal/freelance** | **845** | **73.7%** | **2,601 baht** | **71.7%** |

| **State enterprise** | 4 | 0.3% | 21,500 baht | 25.0% |
| **Total employed** | **1,147** | **100%** | — | — |

**CRITICAL FINDING**: 73.7% of employed elderly are informal workers - the VAST MAJORITY work in informal sector.

## 3. Formal vs Informal Workers (Among Employed)

### Comparison

**Definition**:
- **Formal workers**: Government (code 1) + State enterprise (code 2) + Company employee (code 3)
- **Informal workers**: Informal/freelance (code 6)

| Category | Count | % of Employed | Average Income | Disease Rate |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Informal workers** | **845** | **73.7%** | **2,601 baht** | 71.7% |
| **Formal workers** | 109 | 9.5% | 15,444 baht | 64.2% |
| **Gap** | — | — | **-12,843 baht** | +7.5pp |
| **p-value** | — | — | **p<0.000001 ✅✅✅** | p=0.1053 (NS) |

---

### Income Gap: Formal 5.9× Higher than Informal ✅ HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT

| Worker Type | Income | Sample Size |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Formal workers | 15,444 baht | n=76 |
| Informal workers | 2,601 baht | n=626 |
| **Gap** | **+12,843 baht** | — |
| **Multiplier** | **Formal earns 5.9× more** | — |
| **p-value** | **p<0.000001 ✅✅✅** | — |

**Interpretation**: Formal workers earn 5.9× more than informal workers (p<0.000001, highly significant). This is a MASSIVE income gap.

---

### Disease Gap: NOT Significant

| Worker Type | Chronic Disease |
|------------|----------------|
| Formal workers | 64.2% |
| Informal workers | 71.7% |
| **Gap** | **-7.5pp** |
| **p-value** | **p=0.1053 (NOT significant)** |

**Interpretation**: Formal workers have 7.5pp less disease, but this gap is NOT statistically significant (p=0.1053). Small sample of formal workers (n=109) limits statistical power.

---

## 4. Income Hierarchy by Occupation Type

### Complete Ranking

| Occupation Type | Average Income | Sample Size | Multiplier vs Informal |
|----------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Government employee** | 24,400 baht | n=7 | **9.4× informal** |
| **State enterprise** | 21,500 baht | n=4 | **8.3× informal** |
| **Company employee** | 14,519 baht | n=98 | **5.6× informal** |
| **Own business** | 9,527 baht | n=97 | **3.7× informal** |
| **Other** | 2,919 baht | n=95 | **1.1× informal** |
| **Informal/freelance** | **2,601 baht** | n=845 | **(baseline)** |

**Key Pattern**:
- Government workers earn 9.4× more than informal workers
- Even "own business" earns 3.7× more than informal
- Informal workers have the LOWEST income of all occupation types

## 5. Statistical Summary

### ✅ SIGNIFICANT Correlations (p<0.05)

| Correlation | Effect Size | p-value | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Employed → Less disease** | **-12.5pp** | **p<0.000001** | Employed have significantly less disease |
| **Formal → Higher income** | **+12,843 baht (5.9×)** | **p<0.000001** | Formal earn massively more than informal |

---

### ❌ NOT Significant (p>0.05)

| Correlation | Effect Size | p-value | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Formal → Less disease | -7.5pp | p=0.1053 | Gap exists but not statistically significant |

## 6. Key Insights

### 1. **73.7% of Employed Elderly Are Informal Workers**

This is the DOMINANT employment type. Nearly 3 in 4 working elderly are in informal sector.

**Implications**:
- Very low income (2,601 baht) - lowest of all occupation types
- No job security
- No retirement benefits
- No social protection
- Working at age 72.4 likely due to economic necessity

---

### 2. **Employed Elderly Have 12.5pp Less Disease (p<0.000001)**

Strong correlation between employment and better health.

**Possible mechanisms** (NOT tested):
- Healthier elderly can work → selection bias
- Work provides activity, social connection → health benefits
- Income from work enables healthcare, nutrition → health benefits

**Temporal direction unclear**: Does health enable work, or does work improve health?

---

### 3. **Massive Income Gap: Formal 5.9× Informal (p<0.000001)**

Formal workers: 15,444 baht
Informal workers: 2,601 baht

This is one of the LARGEST income gaps in the entire study.

**Comparison to other groups**:
- Disabled education gap: 2.84× income (highest education multiplier)
- **Elderly formal/informal gap: 5.9× income** (even larger!)

**Implication**: Occupation type matters MORE than education for elderly income.

---

### 4. **Why Are 73.7% in Informal Sector?**

Possible reasons (NOT tested):
- Forced into informal work due to lack of formal retirement income
- Mandatory retirement age pushes elderly out of formal sector
- Formal sector won't hire elderly workers (age discrimination)
- Lost formal jobs, can only find informal work
- Need flexible hours due to health limitations

**This explains the "no employment contract → low income" correlation** I found earlier - it's actually "informal sector → low income" at age 72.4.

---

### 5. **Income Hierarchy Reflects Job Security**

Highest income = most job security:
1. Government (24,400 baht) - permanent employment, pension
2. State enterprise (21,500 baht) - stable employment
3. Company employee (14,519 baht) - formal contract
4. Own business (9,527 baht) - self-employment
5. Informal (2,601 baht) - zero security

**Pattern**: More job security → Higher income in retirement.

---

## 7. What This Does NOT Show

Variables NOT measured:
- **Retirement income vs work income** (can't separate pension from current earnings)
- **Years in formal vs informal sector** (lifetime employment history not collected)
- **Reasons for informal work** (choice vs necessity not measured)
- **Working hours** (full-time vs part-time not measured)
- **Job satisfaction** (not measured)
- **Health insurance coverage** (by occupation type not analyzed)
- **Savings/assets** (not measured)
- **Why working at age 72.4** (economic necessity vs preference not tested)
- **Temporal sequence** (health before vs after employment not measured)

---

## 8. Recommended Replacement for "Employment Contract" Pathway

### OLD Pathway 1 (INCORRECT):
"Past employment contracts correlate with current income (+46%)"

**Problem**: This was based on incorrect interpretation. The actual variable is **current occupation status**, not past contracts.

---

### NEW Pathway 1 (CORRECT):

**Pathway 1: Current Occupation Status (38.4% still working at age 72.4)**

| Occupation Status | Chronic Disease | Income Data |
|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Employed (38.4%) | 71.1% | 2,601-24,400 baht (varies by type) |
| Unemployed (61.6%) | 83.5% | No income data (survey skips) |
| **Gap** | **-12.5pp** | — |
| **p-value** | **p<0.000001 ✅** | — |

**Among employed elderly (n=1,147)**:

| Occupation Type | % of Employed | Income | Disease |
|----------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Informal/freelance** | **73.7%** | **2,601 baht** | 71.7% |
| Formal workers | 9.5% | 15,444 baht (5.9× higher) | 64.2% |
| Own business | 8.5% | 9,527 baht | 70.1% |
| Other | 8.3% | 2,919 baht | 73.7% |

**Formal vs Informal Income Gap**:
- Formal: 15,444 baht (n=76)
- Informal: 2,601 baht (n=626)
- Gap: +12,843 baht (5.9×, p<0.000001) ✅ HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT

**Explanation**: 38.4% of elderly still work at age 72.4. Employed elderly have 12.5pp less chronic disease (p<0.000001). However, 73.7% work in informal sector earning only 2,601 baht - the LOWEST income of all occupation types. Formal workers earn 5.9× more (p<0.000001). Temporal direction unclear (does health enable work, or does work improve health?). Mechanisms unknown.

**Statistical Note**: All correlations show associations only, NOT causation. Temporal direction unclear (health enabling work vs work improving health). Unemployed elderly have no income data because survey skips income question for non-working respondents. Mechanisms for correlations unknown (retirement systems, age discrimination, health selection not measured).
