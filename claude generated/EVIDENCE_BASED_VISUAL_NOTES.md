# Evidence-Based Visual Presentation Notes

## Critical Updates for SDHE_VISUAL_DIAGRAMS.md

**Date**: 2025-11-17
**Purpose**: Document required changes to align visual diagrams with evidence-based storytelling principle

---

## Key Changes Required

### 1. Remove ALL Assumption-Based Text

**BEFORE (assumption-based)**:
- "Why smoking rates are elevated: precarious employment creates stress"
- "Income buys wheelchair maintenance, therapy, devices = ~5,500฿/mo"
- "Cannot evacuate, devices destroyed, trapped by immobility"
- "High-income elderly CHOOSE crowded apartments near hospitals"

**AFTER (evidence-based)**:
- "Smoking 16.2% (informal) vs 10.0% (general), +6.2pp, p<0.001, reasons unknown"
- "Income correlates with disease r=-0.299, p=0.003, mechanisms unknown (devices/therapy not measured)"
- "Homeowners +19.6pp more disaster exposure, p=0.002, mechanisms unknown (evacuation not measured)"
- "High-income elderly 48.1% overcrowded vs 37.6%, +10.4pp, p=0.006, reasons unknown (hospital proximity not measured)"

### 2. Replace Causal Labels with Correlation Labels

**Pathway Labels**:
- ❌ "DIRECT EFFECT!" → ✅ "DIRECT CORRELATION!"
- ❌ "STRESS INDICATOR" → ✅ "OBSERVED DIFFERENCE, reasons unknown"
- ❌ "BREAKS EVERYTHING" → ✅ "Highest discrimination, mechanisms unknown"
- ❌ "PROTECTIVE" → ✅ "CORRELATES WITH (mechanisms unknown)"

### 3. Update Statistical Notations

**Add p-values and "NOT significant" markers**:
- LGBT+ education: "0.99× multiplier (p=0.993, NOT significant)"
- Disabled harmful coping: "Smoking +27.2pp (p=0.089, NOT significant)"
- Elderly income→disease: "No correlation (p=0.095, NOT significant)"

### 4. Replace "Mechanism" Boxes with "Statistical Observations"

**Disabled Amplification Section BEFORE**:
```
│  📖 FUNCTIONAL SKILLS (5% embedded in education)             │
│  • Math skills: +21.4 pp (budgeting for devices, medical    │
│    costs, assistive tech purchases)                          │
│  • Writing skills: +21.4 pp (advocacy, navigating           │
│    bureaucracy, medical documentation)                       │
│  → Literacy enables INDEPENDENCE & SELF-ADVOCACY            │
```

**AFTER**:
```
│  📖 FUNCTIONAL SKILLS (5% embedded in education)             │
│  • Math skills: +21.4 pp (p=0.021) ✅ PROVEN CORRELATION    │
│  • Writing skills: +21.4 pp (p=0.021) ✅ PROVEN CORRELATION │
│  → Mechanisms for how literacy correlates with health:      │
│    UNKNOWN (self-advocacy, budgeting not measured)           │
```

### 5. Update Harmful Coping Section (Disabled)

**BEFORE**:
```
│  ⚠️ High-income disabled show HARMFUL coping patterns:      │
│  • Smoking: 27.2% vs 0% low-income                           │
│  → Resources enable substance use as stress-coping          │
│  → Poverty acts as "protective constraint"                  │
│  → Medical constraints + disability = chronic stress        │
```

**AFTER**:
```
│  ⚠️ High-income disabled show MARGINAL patterns:            │
│  • Smoking: 27.2% vs 0%, +27.2pp (p=0.089, NOT significant) │
│  • Drinking: 46.9% vs 25%, +21.9pp (p=0.265, NOT significant)│
│  → Small sample (n=113), patterns NOT statistically proven  │
│  → Mechanisms: UNKNOWN (stress, affordability not measured) │
```

### 6. Update "KEY INSIGHTS" to Evidence-Based

**Informal Workers**:
- ❌ "Education unlocks EVERYTHING - income, exercise, homeownership, health literacy"
- ✅ "Education correlates with income (1.84×), exercise (+13.6pp), homeownership (+12.2pp) - mechanisms not established"

**Elderly**:
- ❌ "Past matters more than present - employment contracts determined retirement security"
- ✅ "Employment contracts correlate with +46% income in retirement (p<0.0001), mechanisms unknown"

**LGBT+**:
- ❌ "Structural discrimination has ELIMINATED ALL normal SDHE pathways"
- ✅ "Education shows NO correlation with income (p=0.993). Income correlates with housing/healthcare but also drinking/violence. Mechanisms: unknown"

**Disabled**:
- ❌ "Amplification works BOTH WAYS - education creates 2.84× income gap"
- ✅ "Education correlates 2.84× with income (p<0.001). Income correlates with disease r=-0.299 (p=0.003). Mechanisms: unknown"

## Arrow Labels to Update

### Change FROM → TO:

1. **Education → Income**:
   - FROM: Solid arrow (implies causation)
   - TO: Solid arrow with label "r=X.XX, p<0.001, CORRELATION"

2. **Income → Disease**:
   - FROM: Arrow labeled "enables access to care"
   - TO: Arrow labeled "r=-0.299, p=0.003, mechanisms unknown"

3. **Discrimination → Smoking**:
   - FROM: One-way arrow
   - TO: Double arrow "↔" with label "bidirectional correlation observed, p<0.05"

4. **LGBT+ Education → Income**:
   - FROM: Crossed-out arrow with ❌
   - TO: Dotted arrow with label "NO CORRELATION (p=0.993)"

---

## Statistical Legend Updates

Add to legend:
- **NS** = Not Significant (p>0.05)
- **✅ PROVEN** = Statistically significant correlation (p<0.05)
- **Mechanisms unknown** = Correlation observed but causal pathway not established
- **Not measured** = Variable not included in data collection

---

## Quick Reference Table Update

**FROM**:
| Population | #1 Factor | Unique Finding | Crisis Level |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Disabled** | Education (32%) | Highest amplification (2.84×) | 61.1% skip care (WORST) |

**TO**:
| Population | #1 Factor | Unique Finding | Crisis Level |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Disabled** | Education (32%) | Highest income correlation (2.84×, p<0.001) | 61.1% skip care (p<0.001, WORST) |

---

## Implementation Priority

1. ✅ COMPLETED: Update Informal Workers section (smoking, final outcome)
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Update Elderly section (healthcare, housing paradox, final outcome)
3. ✅ COMPLETED: Update LGBT+ section (discrimination, education, vicious cycles, final outcome)
4. ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Update Disabled section (need to fix special character issues in ASCII diagram)
5. ⚠️ PENDING: Update all "KEY INSIGHTS" boxes across all 4 groups
6. ⚠️ PENDING: Update statistical legend
7. ⚠️ PENDING: Update quick reference table

---

## Note on Disabled Section Technical Issues

The Disabled section ASCII diagram contains special characters (฿) that are causing Edit tool failures. Options:

1. **Manual edit**: User manually updates the Disabled diagram section
2. **Recreate section**: Use Write tool to completely recreate lines 332-462 with evidence-based text
3. **Summary document**: Create separate evidence-based summary (this document) for reference

**Recommendation**: Use this document as a guide to manually update SDHE_VISUAL_DIAGRAMS.md, particularly the Disabled section which has formatting challenges.

---

## Completion Status

- ✅ SDHE_STORYTELLING_FLOWS.md: ALL sections updated (Informal, Elderly, LGBT+, Disabled)
- 🔄 SDHE_VISUAL_DIAGRAMS.md: Partially updated (Informal ✅, Elderly ✅, LGBT+ ✅, Disabled ⚠️ technical issues)
- ✅ EVIDENCE_BASED_STORYTELLING_PRINCIPLE.md: Created with guidelines
- ✅ EVIDENCE_BASED_VISUAL_NOTES.md: Created with specific diagram updates needed

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Disabled section updates in SDHE_VISUAL_DIAGRAMS.md
2. Update all "Presentation Order" sections to reflect evidence-based language
3. Update Visual Design Guidelines section to mention "correlation" vs "causation" labeling
4. Add "mechanisms unknown" to all arrow labels in ASCII diagrams
