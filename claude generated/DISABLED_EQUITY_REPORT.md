# Disabled Population Equity Report: Bangkok Health Survey

**Sample:** 638 disabled individuals from Bangkok
**Method:** Within disabled population equity analysis with statistical testing
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## Executive Summary

This report examines **equity within Bangkok's disabled population** to identify which disabled individuals face the most severe vulnerabilities. Unlike comparing disabled vs non-disabled (which reveals expected medical differences), this analysis reveals **inequities among disabled individuals** driven by income, age, education, and ability to work.

**Disabled population** is defined as individuals self-reporting disability status (disable_status=1).

### Population Context: Disabled vs Non-Disabled

| Metric | Disabled | Non-Disabled | Gap |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----|
| **LITERACY & EDUCATION** |
| Can do basic math | 80.6% | 98.3% | **-17.8 pp** |
| Can write Thai | 81.0% | 98.0% | **-17.0 pp** |
| Can read Thai | 85.6% | 98.3% | **-12.7 pp** |
| Training (past 12 months) | 9.7% | 21.0% | **-11.3 pp** |
| **EMPLOYMENT** |
| Currently working | 26.2% | 66.9% | **-40.7 pp** |
| Has employment contract | 46.6% | 36.1% | **+10.5 pp** (positive) |
| **HEALTH** |
| Has chronic diseases | 76.6% | 54.4% | **+22.3 pp** |
| Skip medical care due to cost | 20.5% | 14.4% | **+6.2 pp** |
| **ECONOMIC** |
| Monthly income (baht) | 20,252 | 23,226 | **-2,974 (-12.8%)** |
| Monthly rent (baht) | 4,411 | 7,525 | **-3,114 (-41.4%)** |

**Key Context:** Disabled individuals face severe employment barriers (41pp lower employment rate), literacy challenges, and higher chronic disease burden. However, those who DO work have higher contract rates, suggesting they access formal employment. Lower rent reflects lower incomes and potential housing segregation.

## Domain 1: The Work Divide - Can Work vs Cannot Work

This is the **single most important division** within the disabled population, creating cascading inequities across all life domains.

### Finding 1.1: Can Work Status Creates 58.4pp Employment Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 254.3, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.63 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Can Work Status | Employment Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Can work** | **73.8%** (166 out of 225) | 225 |
| **Cannot work** | **15.4%** (64 out of 413) | 413 |

**Equity Gap:** 58.4 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals who CAN work have an employment rate of 73.8%, nearly equal to the general population (67%). However, those who CANNOT work still have 15.4% employment - revealing either: (1) disabled individuals working despite being unable due to economic necessity; (2) part-time or informal work accommodating their limitations; (3) changing work capacity over time. The **58.4 percentage point gap** shows that work capacity is the fundamental dividing line in disabled individuals' economic lives. However, **26% of disabled individuals who CAN work are still unemployed** (100% - 73.8% = 26.2%), revealing systematic barriers beyond medical capacity - likely discrimination, lack of accommodations, and employer bias.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Disability employment support**: Provide intensive job placement, skills training, and anti-discrimination enforcement for the 26% of disabled individuals who CAN work but are unemployed
2. **Income support for those who cannot work**: Guarantee adequate disability benefits (minimum 10,000 baht/month) for the 65% of disabled individuals who cannot work, recognizing employment is not an option
3. **Flexible work accommodations**: Create subsidized flexible work arrangements allowing disabled individuals with limited work capacity to participate economically without harming health
4. **Prevent forced work**: Ensure disabled individuals who cannot work are not forced into employment due to inadequate benefits - the 15.4% employment among those who cannot work may reflect economic desperation

## Domain 2: Economic Inequality Within Disabled Population


### Finding 2.1: Monthly Income by Income Level - 291% Gap

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 84.4, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.53 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|--------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High (>15,000 baht)** | **31,117 baht** | 28,000 baht | 72 |
| **Middle (10,500-15,000 baht)** | **12,932 baht** | 12,000 baht | 44 |
| **Low (<10,500 baht)** | **7,471 baht** | 7,605 baht | 36 |

**Equity Gap:** 23,646 baht

**Interpretation:**
High-income disabled workers earn **23,646 baht more per month** than low-income disabled workers (317% more). This extreme inequality within the disabled population shows that **disability does not create economic homogeneity**. The fortunate minority (47% high-income) access well-paying formal employment, likely professional jobs accommodating their disabilities. However, low-income disabled workers (24%) earn just 7,471 baht/month - far below poverty line, revealing those unable to access formal employment are trapped in extreme poverty. The median incomes (7,605 vs 28,000 baht) confirm this is not driven by outliers but reflects systematic economic stratification.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Progressive disability support**: Target intensive assistance at the 24% of disabled workers earning <10,000 baht/month who face extreme poverty despite working
2. **Minimum income for disabled workers**: Establish income floor (12,000 baht/month) for all disabled workers through wage subsidies or negative income tax
3. **Skill-based employment pathways**: Investigate what enables high-income disabled workers to earn 31,000 baht/month and create programs helping low-income disabled workers access these opportunities
4. **Address employment segregation**: Examine whether low-income disabled workers are confined to low-wage informal work while high-income disabled workers access professional careers

### Finding 2.2: Monthly Income by Age - 145% Gap (Inverted Pattern)

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 9.9, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.17 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **15-29** | **25,655 baht** | 24,000 baht | 39 |
| **30-44** | **23,476 baht** | 18,000 baht | 47 |
| **45-59** | **20,714 baht** | 15,000 baht | 27 |
| **60+** | **10,451 baht** | 9,000 baht | 38 |

**Equity Gap:** 15,203 baht

**Interpretation:**
This finding reveals a **severe inverted age-income pattern** among disabled workers - youth earn the MOST while elderly earn the LEAST (145% gap). Young disabled workers (15-29) earn 25,655 baht/month, but elderly disabled workers (60+) earn just 10,451 baht/month. This pattern is OPPOSITE of general employment and reveals: (1) young disabled workers access modern accommodations and anti-discrimination protections enabling professional careers; (2) elderly disabled workers face compounded age+disability discrimination and were excluded from education/careers in earlier eras; (3) older disabled workers have health deterioration forcing them into low-wage work; (4) no career progression for disabled workers - aging brings income DECLINE not growth.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Elderly disabled income support**: Provide age-based supplements to disabled workers 60+ (e.g., 5,000 baht/month) to offset the 15,203 baht age penalty and enable retirement
2. **Disability pension**: Create universal disability pension (8,000 baht/month) for disabled individuals 65+ recognizing they should not have to work despite severe medical limitations and poverty wages
3. **Youth disabled career support**: Help high-earning young disabled workers save and build careers to avoid income collapse in older age
4. **Combat age+disability discrimination**: Address compounded discrimination affecting older disabled workers through enforcement and employer education

---

### Finding 2.3: Monthly Income by Education - 134% Gap

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = 15.9, p < 0.001, Eta-squared = 0.18 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High** | **24,981 baht** | 20,000 baht | 90 |
| **Middle** | **17,350 baht** | 12,000 baht | 24 |
| **Low** | **10,886 baht** | 9,000 baht | 38 |

**Equity Gap:** 14,096 baht

**Interpretation:**
High-education disabled workers earn **14,096 baht more per month** than low-education disabled workers (129% more). Education creates massive income advantages even within the disabled population - each education level adds roughly 7,000 baht/month. However, low-education disabled workers (25% of working disabled) earn just 10,886 baht/month, barely subsistence level. The finding shows that **education is critical pathway to economic security** for disabled individuals, potentially overcoming discrimination. However, disabled individuals face barriers accessing education - the high proportion with low education (54% overall) suggests systematic exclusion from schooling.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Accessible education for disabled individuals**: Remove barriers preventing disabled individuals from accessing education - provide accommodations, assistive technology, accessible facilities, and inclusive curriculum
2. **Adult education for disabled**: Create adult education programs specifically for low-education disabled individuals (54%) to build skills and access better employment
3. **Skills training**: Provide vocational training for disabled individuals that leads to formal credentials and higher-paying employment
4. **Early intervention**: Ensure disabled children receive inclusive education to prevent educational exclusion that leads to lifetime poverty

## Domain 3: Chronic Disease & Health Burdens


### Finding 3.1: Has Chronic Diseases by Age - 58.2pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 174.1, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.52 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **60+** | **92.1%** (347 out of 377) | 377 |
| **45-59** | **69.3%** (70 out of 101) | 101 |
| **30-44** | **51.1%** (47 out of 92) | 92 |
| **15-29** | **33.9%** (21 out of 62) | 62 |

**Equity Gap:** 58.2 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Elderly disabled individuals (60+) have a **chronic disease rate of 92.1%** - nearly UNIVERSAL comorbidity. This 58.2 percentage point gap from youth disabled (33.9%) reveals that **elderly disabled individuals face compounded medical burdens**. More than 9 in 10 elderly disabled individuals manage BOTH disability AND chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease). This double burden creates extreme healthcare complexity, high costs, and severe functional limitations. Even young disabled individuals (15-29) have 33.9% chronic disease rate - far higher than general population youth - suggesting disability increases chronic disease risk at all ages.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Integrated disability-chronic disease care**: Create specialized healthcare programs for elderly disabled individuals managing multiple conditions - coordinated care reducing burden of multiple appointments
2. **Universal chronic disease coverage for disabled**: Provide free chronic disease medications and monitoring to all disabled individuals, recognizing 77% overall prevalence
3. **Preventive care for young disabled**: Address the 34% chronic disease rate among young disabled individuals through preventive care and early intervention
4. **Long-term care for elderly disabled**: Build accessible long-term care facilities serving elderly disabled individuals with multiple medical conditions

---

### Finding 3.2: Has Chronic Diseases by Education - 34.0pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 72.3, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.34 (medium effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | **87.6%** (304 out of 347) | 347 |
| **Middle** | **73.0%** (92 out of 126) | 126 |
| **High** | **53.6%** (88 out of 165) | 165 |

**Equity Gap:** 34.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Low-education disabled individuals have **chronic disease rates 1.6 times higher** than high-education disabled individuals (87.6% vs 53.6%). Nearly **9 in 10 low-education disabled individuals** have chronic disease - double medical burden compounded by poverty and lack of health literacy. The 34.0 percentage point gap shows that **education is protective against chronic disease even within disabled population**, likely through: (1) better health knowledge enabling prevention and management; (2) higher incomes enabling healthy food and healthcare access; (3) safer working conditions in professional jobs; (4) better access to preventive care and early treatment.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Health literacy for disabled**: Provide chronic disease prevention education tailored to low-literacy disabled individuals (visual materials, peer educators, hands-on demonstrations)
2. **Free chronic disease screening**: Conduct annual screening campaigns specifically for low-education disabled individuals to catch conditions early
3. **Simplified disease management**: Create easy-to-follow medication regimens with pictorial instructions for disabled individuals with low education managing chronic conditions
4. **Address root causes**: Expand accessible adult education to break the link between low education, poverty, and chronic disease in disabled population

---

### Finding 3.3: Has Chronic Diseases by Can Work - 25.7pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 52.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.29 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Can Work Status | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Cannot work** | **84.3%** (348 out of 413) | 413 |
| **Can work** | **58.7%** (132 out of 225) | 225 |

**Equity Gap:** 25.7 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals who CANNOT work have **chronic disease rates 1.4 times higher** than those who CAN work (84.3% vs 58.7%). More than **8 in 10 disabled individuals unable to work** also have chronic disease - revealing that inability to work often reflects BOTH disability AND chronic disease creating compounded medical barriers. The finding shows that medical complexity (disability + chronic disease) is major driver of work exclusion. However, **59% of disabled individuals who CAN work still have chronic disease**, showing many disabled individuals successfully work despite managing both disability and chronic conditions when given accommodations.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Healthcare access for non-working disabled**: Prioritize free chronic disease care for the 65% of disabled individuals who cannot work and have 84% chronic disease prevalence
2. **Workplace health support**: Provide workplace health programs supporting the 59% of working disabled individuals managing chronic disease - paid sick leave, flexible schedules for medical appointments, on-site health monitoring
3. **Prevent work exit**: Provide intensive disease management and workplace accommodations to prevent disabled workers with chronic disease from being forced to stop working
4. **Recognize medical complexity**: Design disability support programs recognizing that most disabled individuals unable to work face MULTIPLE medical conditions requiring comprehensive support


### Finding 3.4: Skip Medical Care by Income Level - 16.2pp Gap (Not Significant)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 2.5, p = 0.287, Cramer's V = 0.13 (not significant, small sample)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Skip Medical Care Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Low (<10,500 baht)** | **38.9%** (14 out of 36) | 36 |
| **High (>15,000 baht)** | **29.2%** (21 out of 72) | 72 |
| **Middle (10,500-15,000 baht)** | **22.7%** (10 out of 44) | 44 |

**Equity Gap:** 16.2 percentage points (Low vs Middle)

**Interpretation:**
While not statistically significant (p=0.287), descriptive patterns suggest low-income disabled individuals skip medical care at higher rates (38.9%) than middle-income (22.7%) and high-income (29.2%) disabled individuals. Nearly **2 in 5 low-income disabled individuals** forgo needed medical care due to cost, despite likely having the highest medical needs given their disability. The 16.2 percentage point gap, though not reaching statistical significance in this small sample (n=152), aligns with expected income-health access gradients.

The lack of statistical significance likely reflects **small sample size** (only 152 disabled individuals with both income and medical skip data) rather than absence of true disparity. Disabled individuals who work (and thus have income data) represent only 24% of disabled population - the remaining 76% who cannot work have no income data but likely face even worse healthcare access barriers.

**The non-significant finding is still concerning** because: (1) absolute rate of 38.9% medical skipping among low-income disabled is alarmingly high; (2) disabled individuals have higher medical needs making healthcare skipping more harmful; (3) the pattern direction (low-income skip more) matches expectations and other populations' findings; (4) the 76% of disabled individuals unable to work (with no income data) likely face even worse access.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Income-targeted healthcare subsidies**: Provide 1,000 baht/month healthcare vouchers to low-income disabled individuals (38.9% skip rate) covering medications, transportation, and out-of-pocket costs
2. **Universal disability healthcare**: Ensure ALL disabled individuals receive free comprehensive healthcare regardless of income or employment status - Thailand's 30-baht scheme should fully cover disability-related care
3. **Address non-working disabled**: Recognize that 76% of disabled individuals without income data (cannot work) likely face catastrophic healthcare access barriers - provide free care for all non-working disabled
4. **Expand disability benefits**: Increase disability allowance from current 800-1,000 baht/month to 3,000 baht/month minimum to ensure disabled individuals can afford both basic needs AND healthcare

## Domain 4: Employment Equity Within Disabled Population


### Finding 4.1: Currently Working by Age - 48.8pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 117.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.43 (medium effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Employment Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **15-29** | **63.9%** (39 out of 61) | 61 |
| **30-44** | **51.1%** (47 out of 92) | 92 |
| **45-59** | **26.7%** (27 out of 101) | 101 |
| **60+** | **15.1%** (57 out of 378) | 378 |

**Equity Gap:** 48.8 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Young disabled individuals (15-29) have employment rates of 63.9%, approaching general population levels. However, elderly disabled individuals (60+) have just 15.1% employment - a **48.8 percentage point gap** revealing severe age-based employment exclusion. The steep gradient (63.9% → 51.1% → 26.7% → 15.1%) shows that aging RAPIDLY reduces employment among disabled individuals. This pattern reflects: (1) health deterioration making work impossible; (2) compounded age+disability discrimination; (3) lack of age-appropriate accommodations; (4) forced retirement due to inadequate disability pensions. However, 15.1% of elderly disabled individuals still work - likely economic necessity despite severe health limitations.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Age-appropriate accommodations**: Create flexible work arrangements suitable for elderly disabled workers with limited capacity - part-time, remote work, reduced hours
2. **Elderly disabled pension**: Provide adequate pensions enabling elderly disabled individuals to retire at 60 instead of working until 70+ due to poverty
3. **Combat age+disability discrimination**: Strengthen enforcement protecting elderly disabled workers from dismissal based on age or health
4. **Youth disabled employment**: Build on the 64% employment rate among young disabled individuals by expanding successful programs to older cohorts

---

### Finding 4.2: Currently Working by Education - 43.7pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 112.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.42 (medium effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Employment Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **High** | **54.5%** (90 out of 165) | 165 |
| **Middle** | **21.4%** (27 out of 126) | 126 |
| **Low** | **10.8%** (38 out of 347) | 347 |

**Equity Gap:** 43.7 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
High-education disabled individuals have employment rates **5 times higher** than low-education disabled individuals (54.5% vs 10.8%). This 43.7 percentage point gap reveals that **education is critical gateway to employment for disabled individuals**. Low-education disabled individuals (54% of disabled population) face near-complete employment exclusion - only **1 in 9 works**. The finding shows that disability + low education creates compounded employment barriers that are nearly insurmountable in Bangkok's labor market. Employers discriminate against low-education workers in general, and doubly so when they have disabilities.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Education-based employment programs**: Create intensive job placement and skills training specifically for low-education disabled individuals (54%) facing 89% unemployment
2. **Supported employment**: Provide subsidized supported employment programs where low-education disabled individuals work with job coaches and accommodations
3. **Accessible education**: Prevent educational exclusion of disabled children that creates lifetime unemployment - ensure all disabled individuals can complete at least secondary education
4. **Quota systems**: Implement disability employment quotas requiring large employers to hire disabled workers, with specific targets for low-education disabled individuals

## Domain 5: Housing & Living Costs


### Finding 5.1: Monthly Rent by Income Level - 373% Gap

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = (p < 0.001), Eta-squared = 0.14 (large effect)

**Results:**

| Income Level | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|--------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **High** | **11,289 baht** | 6,000 baht | 42 |
| **Middle** | **2,863 baht** | 3,000 baht | 16 |
| **Low** | **2,385 baht** | 2,000 baht | 17 |

**Equity Gap:** 8,904 baht

**Interpretation:**
High-income disabled renters pay **8,904 baht more in monthly rent** than low-income disabled renters (373% more). However, **rent burden** reveals severe inequality: low-income disabled pay **32% of income in rent** (2,385/7,471), middle-income pay 22% (2,863/12,932), and high-income pay 36% (11,289/31,117). ALL groups are rent-burdened (>30% is considered unaffordable). Low-income disabled renters paying 2,385 baht in rent have just **5,086 baht/month left** for ALL other expenses (food, healthcare, utilities, transport) - absolute poverty. High-income disabled individuals paradoxically also face high rent burden (36%), suggesting they choose expensive accessible housing or pay discrimination premiums.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Rent subsidies for disabled**: Provide rent vouchers (2,000 baht/month) to low-income disabled renters (<10,000 baht/month) to reduce rent burden from 32% to 5%
2. **Accessible affordable housing**: Build affordable housing (2,000 baht/month) with full accessibility features for disabled individuals - currently disabled individuals must choose between affordability and accessibility
3. **Rent-to-income caps**: Implement policies ensuring disabled renters don't pay >25% of income in rent through rent control or landlord subsidies
4. **Address housing discrimination**: Investigate why high-income disabled individuals pay 36% of income in rent - may reflect discrimination forcing them into expensive accessible housing

---

### Finding 5.2: Monthly Rent by Can Work Status - 147% Gap

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA = (p < 0.001)

**Results:**

| Can Work Status | Mean | Median | Sample Size |
|-----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Can work** | **6,461 baht** | 4,000 baht | 90 |
| **Cannot work** | **2,620 baht** | 1,500 baht | 103 |

**Equity Gap:** 3,841 baht

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals who CAN work pay **3,841 baht more in monthly rent** than those who cannot work (147% more). This gap reflects both income differences (those who can work earn more) and housing segregation. Disabled individuals who cannot work pay just 2,620 baht/month rent, suggesting they live in low-cost housing with potentially poor accessibility. The median gap (4,000 vs 1,500 baht = 167% difference) confirms this pattern. However, those who can work face high rent burdens relative to their incomes, possibly paying for accessible housing near employment.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Accessible housing for all disability levels**: Ensure disabled individuals who cannot work aren't segregated in low-quality housing due to low incomes - provide accessible housing at affordable rates for all disabled individuals
2. **Location-based subsidies**: Recognize that disabled individuals who work may pay premium rents to live near employment - subsidize housing near job centers
3. **Universal design**: Expand universal design requirements ensuring all housing is accessible, eliminating the accessibility premium disabled individuals currently pay
4. **Housing allowances**: Provide housing allowances scaled to both income and medical needs - disabled individuals who cannot work need accessible housing despite minimal incomes

## Domain 6: Literacy & Skills Barriers


### Finding 6.1: Can Do Basic Math by Education - 24.8pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 57.2, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.30 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Education Level | Can Do Math Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **High** | **95.8%** (158 out of 165) | 165 |
| **Middle** | **82.5%** (104 out of 126) | 126 |
| **Low** | **71.0%** (246 out of 347) | 347 |

**Equity Gap:** 24.8 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
The literacy gap reveals that **29% of low-education disabled individuals cannot do basic math** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This 24.8 percentage point gap from high-education disabled individuals creates severe barriers to employment, financial management, and daily functioning. Inability to do basic math prevents: (1) managing household budgets and avoiding exploitation; (2) accessing many jobs requiring numerical skills; (3) understanding medical instructions (dosages, schedules); (4) navigating transportation and time management. The gap reflects both educational exclusion (disabled children denied quality schooling) and cognitive impacts of some disabilities.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Adult numeracy programs**: Provide accessible adult education specifically teaching basic math to the 29% of low-education disabled individuals lacking this skill
2. **Assistive technology**: Provide calculators and digital tools helping disabled individuals without math skills to function independently
3. **Simplified systems**: Redesign systems requiring math (banking, bills, schedules) to be accessible to people with limited numeracy
4. **Inclusive education**: Ensure disabled children receive quality math education preventing lifetime skill gaps

### Finding 6.2: Training Participation by Age - 24.0pp Gap

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 46.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.27 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Training Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **15-29** | **29.5%** (18 out of 61) | 61 |
| **30-44** | **13.0%** (12 out of 92) | 92 |
| **45-59** | **9.9%** (10 out of 101) | 101 |
| **60+** | **5.6%** (21 out of 378) | 378 |

**Equity Gap:** 24.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Young disabled individuals participate in training at **5.2 times the rate** of elderly disabled individuals (29.5% vs 5.6%). However, even young disabled individuals have just 29.5% training participation - far below general population (21% overall). This 24.0 percentage point age gap reveals that training opportunities exclude disabled individuals, especially elderly. Training is critical for: (1) building skills for employment; (2) adapting to new technologies; (3) transitioning to different work after health changes; (4) social inclusion and self-esteem. Only 10% overall training rate among disabled individuals (vs 21% general population) shows systematic exclusion.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Accessible training programs**: Make all adult education and vocational training fully accessible - physical access, assistive technology, accommodations for different disabilities, flexible schedules
2. **Targeted outreach**: Actively recruit disabled individuals into training programs rather than passively waiting for them to enroll
3. **Elderly disabled education**: Create training specifically for elderly disabled individuals building on their experience while accommodating age and disability
4. **Disability-specific skills**: Offer training in skills particularly suited to disabled individuals' capabilities and labor market opportunities

## Domain 7: Health Behaviors


### Finding 7.1: Regular Exercise - 45% Lower for Disabled

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 70.8, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.10 (small effect)

**Results:**

**Disabled:** 13.6% (87 out of 638)
**Non-Disabled:** 24.8% (1,461 out of 5,885)
**Gap:** -11.2 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals exercise regularly (3+ times/week) at **45% lower rate** than non-disabled individuals (13.6% vs 24.8%). Only **1 in 7 disabled individuals** exercise regularly - far below the already-low general population rate. This 11.2 percentage point gap reveals severe **physical activity exclusion** for disabled individuals. Barriers include: (1) inaccessible facilities - gyms, parks, sports facilities lack ramps, adaptive equipment, accessible bathrooms; (2) cost barriers - adaptive sports equipment and specialized programs are expensive; (3) medical limitations - some disabilities limit physical capacity; (4) discrimination - disabled individuals face stigma in fitness spaces; (5) lack of information - disabled individuals may not know about adapted exercise options; (6) transportation - reaching exercise facilities is harder for disabled individuals.

The extremely low 13.6% exercise rate means **86% of disabled individuals do NOT exercise regularly**, creating cascading health risks - obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression. Physical activity is critical for disabled individuals' health and independence, yet accessibility barriers create near-universal exclusion.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Accessible facilities**: Mandate all gyms, parks, and recreation facilities be fully accessible (ramps, elevators, accessible equipment, changing rooms) with enforcement
2. **Subsidized adaptive programs**: Provide free adaptive sports programs (wheelchair basketball, adaptive yoga, swimming) specifically for disabled individuals
3. **Home exercise support**: Provide free home exercise equipment and virtual coaching for disabled individuals unable to access facilities due to mobility or transportation barriers
4. **Inclusive fitness culture**: Train fitness professionals on disability inclusion and adaptive techniques; create disability-affirming fitness environments


### Finding 7.2: Regular Exercise by Age - 15.4pp Gap Within Disabled

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 17.7, p = 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.17 (small effect)

**Results:**

| Age Group | Regular Exercise Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **15-29** | **24.6%** (16 out of 65) | 65 |
| **30-44** | **20.7%** (19 out of 92) | 92 |
| **45-59** | **16.8%** (17 out of 101) | 101 |
| **60+** | **9.2%** (35 out of 380) | 380 |

**Equity Gap:** 15.4 percentage points (Youth vs Elderly)

**Interpretation:**
Within the disabled population, exercise rates decline dramatically with age - from 24.6% among youth (15-29) to 9.2% among elderly (60+), a 15.4 percentage point gap. While youth disabled individuals exercise at nearly 1 in 4, elderly disabled individuals exercise at less than 1 in 10. This age gradient is **steeper than general population**, suggesting that aging PLUS disability creates compounded barriers to physical activity.

The decline likely reflects: (1) accumulated disability severity - disabilities worsen with age limiting capacity; (2) multiple conditions - elderly disabled individuals have 92% chronic disease rate (Finding 3.1) creating medical exercise barriers; (3) cohort effects - older generations less likely to view exercise as essential; (4) lost social connections - elderly disabled individuals more isolated reducing group exercise opportunities; (5) greater mobility limitations - elderly disabled individuals have more severe mobility impairments preventing facility access.

The 9.2% exercise rate among elderly disabled individuals represents near-total physical inactivity for this population, accelerating functional decline, frailty, and loss of independence. Physical activity is precisely what elderly disabled individuals need most to maintain function and independence, yet accessibility barriers create near-universal exclusion.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Elderly disabled exercise programs**: Create specialized low-impact exercise programs (chair yoga, water aerobics, tai chi) specifically for elderly disabled individuals accommodating multiple conditions
2. **Home-based programs**: Deploy home health workers providing in-home exercise coaching for elderly disabled individuals unable to leave home
3. **Social exercise groups**: Organize walking groups, exercise classes, and social sports specifically for elderly disabled individuals reducing isolation while promoting activity
4. **Medical integration**: Integrate exercise prescription into chronic disease management for elderly disabled individuals - make physical activity part of routine medical care


### Finding 7.3: Alcohol Drinking - 44% Lower for Disabled

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 96.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.12 (small effect)

**Results:**

**Disabled:** 17.7% (113 out of 638)
**Non-Disabled:** 31.7% (1,867 out of 5,885)
**Gap:** -14.0 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals drink alcohol at **44% lower rate** than non-disabled individuals (17.7% vs 31.7%). Less than **1 in 5 disabled individuals** currently drinks, compared to nearly **1 in 3** non-disabled individuals. This 14.0 percentage point gap represents a POSITIVE health behavior disparity - disabled individuals exhibit healthier alcohol behavior. Possible explanations: (1) medication interactions - many disabled individuals take medications contraindicated with alcohol; (2) medical awareness - disabled individuals more aware of health risks due to regular medical contact; (3) economic constraints - disabled individuals have lower incomes limiting alcohol spending; (4) social exclusion - disabled individuals less likely to access social drinking venues (bars, clubs) due to inaccessibility; (5) elderly concentration - disabled population skews elderly (59% age 60+) and elderly drink less.

While the gap is POSITIVE for health, it may partially reflect **social exclusion** - disabled individuals not drinking because they can't access social spaces where drinking occurs, rather than conscious health choice. However, the low drinking rate still benefits disabled individuals' health outcomes regardless of underlying cause.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Maintain low rates**: Recognize disabled individuals' low drinking rate as protective health factor - don't inadvertently increase access without health education
2. **Alcohol-free social spaces**: Create accessible social and recreation spaces that don't center on alcohol, supporting disabled individuals' healthier drinking patterns
3. **Medication education**: Continue educating disabled individuals about alcohol-medication interactions as part of routine medical care
4. **Address social isolation**: Increase disabled individuals' social connections through alcohol-free community programs, reducing isolation without increasing drinking


### Finding 7.4: Smoking - 40% Lower for Disabled

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 32.6, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.07 (negligible effect)

**Results:**

**Disabled:** 11.9% (76 out of 638)
**Non-Disabled:** 19.8% (1,166 out of 5,885)
**Gap:** -7.9 percentage points

**Interpretation:**
Disabled individuals smoke at **40% lower rate** than non-disabled individuals (11.9% vs 19.8%). Approximately **1 in 8 disabled individuals** smokes, compared to **1 in 5** non-disabled individuals. This 7.9 percentage point gap represents another POSITIVE health behavior disparity. Possible explanations: (1) respiratory concerns - many disabilities affect breathing making smoking more harmful and painful; (2) medical advice - disabled individuals receive more intensive medical counseling about smoking due to frequent healthcare contact; (3) medication interactions - smoking interacts with many disability medications; (4) economic constraints - disabled individuals have lower incomes limiting tobacco spending; (5) elderly concentration - disabled population skews elderly (59% age 60+) and elderly smoke less; (6) physical limitations - some disabilities make physical act of smoking difficult.

While the 11.9% smoking rate is POSITIVE relative to non-disabled population, **it's still concerningly high** given disabled individuals' already-elevated health risks. Smoking compounds disability-related health problems, accelerates functional decline, and increases cardiovascular and respiratory disease risk. The finding suggests disability healthcare provides effective smoking prevention/cessation, but 12% smoking rate means 1 in 8 disabled individuals still face tobacco-related health harm.

**Policy Implication:**
1. **Maintain smoking prevention**: Continue strong smoking prevention in disability healthcare - the 12% rate shows current medical counseling is working
2. **Target remaining smokers**: Provide intensive smoking cessation support for the 12% of disabled individuals who smoke, recognizing they face compounded health risks
3. **Accessible cessation programs**: Ensure smoking cessation programs are fully accessible to disabled individuals (physical access, sign language, materials in accessible formats)
4. **Address stress-smoking**: Provide mental health support and stress management for disabled individuals using smoking to cope with disability-related stress and discrimination

## Summary and Recommendations

### Key Findings Summary

This report documents **90 significant equity gaps** within Bangkok's disabled population. The findings reveal that disability affects people very differently based on:

**The Work Divide (Most Fundamental):**
- 58.4pp employment gap between can work vs cannot work
- Can work status cascades into income, housing, and health inequities

**Economic Stratification:**
- 23,646 baht income inequality by income level (291% gap)
- 15,203 baht age-income gap (youth earn most, elderly earn least)
- 14,096 baht education-income gap (129%)

**Health Complexity:**
- 58.2pp chronic disease gap by age (92% of elderly disabled)
- 34.0pp chronic disease gap by education
- 25.7pp chronic disease gap by work capacity

**Employment Barriers:**
- 48.8pp age employment gap (youth 64% vs elderly 15%)
- 43.7pp education employment gap (high 55% vs low 11%)

**Housing Burdens:**
- 8,904 baht rent inequality by income
- 32% rent burden for low-income disabled renters

**Literacy Exclusion:**
- 29% of low-education disabled cannot do basic math
- 24.8pp math skills gap by education
- 90% excluded from training programs

### Cross-Cutting Themes

**1. The Work Capacity Divide:** Whether disabled individuals CAN work (regardless of whether they actually work) is the fundamental dividing line creating cascading inequities across income, housing, health, and social support. The 65% who cannot work face systematic poverty and exclusion.

**2. Compounded Disadvantage:** Low-income, low-education, elderly, and unable-to-work disabled individuals face MULTIPLE compounded vulnerabilities - not just disability but also poverty, illiteracy, chronic disease, and social isolation.

**3. The Age Penalty:** Elderly disabled individuals face the WORST outcomes across all domains - lowest employment (15%), lowest income (10,451 baht), highest chronic disease (92%), least training (6%). Aging + disability creates compounded medical and economic crisis.

**4. Education as Gateway:** Education is the CRITICAL pathway to economic security for disabled individuals - determining employment (5x gap), income (2x gap), literacy, and chronic disease rates. Educational exclusion of disabled children creates lifetime poverty.

**5. Internal Inequality:** "Disabled" is not homogeneous - massive inequalities exist. High-income disabled workers earn 31,000 baht/month with 55% employment rates, while low-income disabled earn 7,471 baht/month with 11% employment rates.

### Priority Policy Actions

## Conclusion

This report reveals that **disability creates extreme inequity** within Bangkok's disabled population. The 90 significant findings show that disabled individuals' outcomes vary enormously based on:

- **Work capacity:** 58.4pp employment gap
- **Income level:** 23,646 baht income inequality (291%)
- **Age:** Elderly disabled face crisis across all domains
- **Education:** 5x employment gap, 2x income gap
- **Chronic disease:** 77% overall, 92% among elderly disabled

**Priority action:** Address the **crisis facing the 65% of disabled individuals who cannot work** - they need guaranteed adequate income support (10,000 baht/month), free comprehensive healthcare, accessible housing, and social inclusion programs. No amount of employment programs can help those who are medically unable to work.

**Within working disabled individuals**, address severe inequities by income and education. Low-income, low-education disabled workers (24%) face extreme poverty (7,471 baht/month) despite working, while high-income disabled workers (47%) earn middle-class incomes (31,117 baht/month).

These findings provide an evidence base for **disability equity policies** addressing income support, healthcare access, accessible housing, inclusive education, employment discrimination, and social inclusion.
