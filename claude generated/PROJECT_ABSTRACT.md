# Bangkok Health Equity Analysis: Project Abstract

## Abstract

This study examines health equity among vulnerable populations in Bangkok through comprehensive analysis of 6,523 survey respondents across 50 districts. Using descriptive stratified analysis with statistical testing, we reveal systematic inequities within four vulnerable groups: elderly (n=2,986), LGBTQ+ individuals (n=685), people with disabilities (n=638), and informal workers (n=1,853).

Our analysis identifies 303 statistically significant equity gaps (p < 0.05) across healthcare access, income, chronic disease, violence, and social support. Key findings include: (1) low-income elderly skip medical care at 5.7 times the rate of high-income elderly (24.1% vs 4.2%, p<0.001); (2) LGBTQ+ individuals experience physical violence at 5.1 times the rate of the general population (13.1% vs 2.6%, p<0.001); (3) 65% of disabled individuals cannot work, relying on inadequate government support of 800 baht/month ($23 USD); and (4) informal workers earn 43% less than formal workers (16,363 vs 28,670 baht/month, p<0.001) with virtually zero legal protections.

Critically, we demonstrate that vulnerable populations are not homogeneous—massive inequities exist within these groups. For example, within the elderly population alone, we identified a 23,646 baht/month income gap between high and low-income subgroups (η²=0.55, large effect). Similarly, low-education informal workers are 3.1 times more likely to be medically prevented from working compared to high-education informal workers (44.7% vs 14.3%, Cramer's V=0.28).

Using internal benchmarking methodology, we calculate achievable targets based on best-performing subgroups. If all elderly achieved the healthcare access rate of high-income elderly (4.2%), skipped care would decrease by 19.8 percentage points, benefiting approximately 600 individuals. This approach provides realistic, evidence-based targets for policy interventions.

We propose 15 priority policy recommendations with quantified impacts, including: (1) tripling elderly allowance to 3,000 baht/month (current: 600-1,000 baht), estimated cost 10 billion baht/year; (2) increasing disability allowance to 10,000 baht/month (current: 800 baht), estimated cost 5 billion baht/year; (3) enacting comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation for LGBTQ+ protection; and (4) establishing minimum income guarantees of 15,000 baht/month for informal workers.

This research demonstrates that one-size-fits-all policies fail to address the diverse needs within vulnerable populations. Effective interventions require targeting specific subgroups facing the most severe vulnerabilities—old-old elderly (80+) need intensive case management, low-income groups need financial assistance, and those medically unable to work need enhanced support. By identifying precise equity gaps with statistical rigor, our findings enable evidence-based policy design that addresses root causes of health inequity in urban populations.

## Research Contributions

1. **Methodological Innovation:** First application of internal benchmarking methodology to urban health equity in Thailand, enabling realistic target-setting without external data requirements.

2. **Within-Group Analysis:** Reveals hidden inequities within vulnerable populations often missed by traditional between-group comparisons (vulnerable vs. general population).

3. **Effect Size Reporting:** Combines statistical significance (p-values) with practical importance (Cramer's V, eta-squared) to prioritize policy interventions.

4. **Actionable Evidence:** All findings linked to specific policy recommendations with estimated costs, beneficiary counts, and expected impacts.

5. **Replicable Framework:** Comprehensive methodology documentation enables application to other cities, countries, and population groups.
