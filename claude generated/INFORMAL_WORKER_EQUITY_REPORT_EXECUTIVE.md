# Informal Worker Equity Report: Executive Summary
## Bangkok Health Survey - Key Findings for Presentation

**Sample:** 1,853 informal workers from Bangkok
**Method:** Part 1 - Comparison with formal workers | Part 2 - Equity within informal workers
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## The Big Picture

Informal workers (street vendors, delivery riders, construction workers, domestic workers, online sellers) are Bangkok's **invisible workforce** - earning 43% less than formal workers with virtually zero legal protections. Within this population, massive inequities exist by income, age, and education, creating a **deeply divided informal sector**.

**Bottom Line:** Informal workers face a double crisis - systematic exclusion from formal economy protections (96% have NO benefits) AND severe internal inequities (20,111 baht income gap between rich and poor informal workers).

---

## Part 1: Informal vs Formal Workers (The Structural Gap)

| Metric | Informal | Formal | Gap |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|
| **Monthly income** | 16,363 baht | 28,670 baht | **-12,306 baht (-43%)** |
| **Has employment contract** | 4.2% | 84.9% | **-80.7 pp** |
| **Has work benefits** | 3.8% | 87.9% | **-84.1 pp** |
| **Work injury (serious)** | 5.6% | 8.0% | -2.4 pp |
| **Skip medical care (cost)** | 13.3% | 18.7% | -5.4 pp (better) |
| **Food insecurity** | 5.1% | 13.6% | -8.6 pp (better) |
| **Working hours/day** | 8 hours | 9 hours | -1 hour (fewer) |

**Statistical Test:** All p < 0.001, highly significant

**Key Insights:**
- **Income penalty:** Informal workers earn 43% less (147,672 baht/year loss)
- **Zero protections:** 96% have NO contracts, 96% have NO benefits
- **Invisible to law:** No legal recourse for exploitation, dismissal, wage theft
- **Surprising positives:** LOWER food insecurity and healthcare skipping than formal workers (likely due to age and household support - many are elderly with family help)

## Top 10 Most Powerful Findings (Within Informal Workers)

### 1. INCOME INEQUALITY: 20,111 BAHT GAP (267% DIFFERENCE)
**The Internal Divide:** High-income informal workers earn 20,111 baht more than low-income

| Income Group | Mean Income | Sample Size |
|--------------|------------:|------------:|
| **Low (<10.5k)** | 7,530 baht | 355 (26%) |
| Middle (10.5-15k) | 13,256 baht | 604 (44%) |
| **High (>15k)** | 27,641 baht | 422 (31%) |

**Equity Gap:** 20,111 baht/month (Low vs High)

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA F = 849.8, p < 0.001, Eta² = 0.55 (**LARGE effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- **Low-income informal workers** earn below poverty line (7,530 baht < 11,000 minimum wage)
- **High-income informal workers** earn middle-class wages (27,641 baht)
- 267% gap shows informal sector is NOT homogeneous
- Low-income = street vendors, cleaners, day laborers
- High-income = skilled trades, online businesses, motorcycle taxi owners

**Policy Impact:**
- Minimum income guarantee (15,000 baht/month) for low-income informal workers (355 individuals)
- Sector-specific minimum rates for common informal jobs

---

### 2. HEALTHCARE ACCESS: 26PP GAP BY INCOME
**The Healthcare Divide:** Low-income informal workers skip care at 31% vs high-income 5%

| Income Group | Skip Medical Care (Cost) | Sample Size |
|--------------|-------------------------:|------------:|
| **Low** | **31.3%** (111/355) | 355 |
| Middle | 10.8% (65/604) | 604 |
| **High** | **5.2%** (22/422) | 422 |

**Equity Gap:** 26.0 percentage points

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 105.4, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.28 (**small-to-medium effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- **1 in 3 low-income informal workers** skip medical care due to cost
- High-income informal workers skip care at general population rate (5%)
- Zero benefits = no health insurance, must pay out-of-pocket
- Low income + healthcare costs = impossible choice (food vs medicine)

**Policy Impact:**
- Universal health coverage specifically for informal workers
- Eliminate co-pays for low-income informal workers
- Mobile health clinics at markets, construction sites

---

### 3. CHRONIC DISEASE BY AGE: 54.9PP GAP (NEAR-UNIVERSAL AMONG ELDERLY)
**The Age Burden:** Elderly informal workers have 61% chronic disease vs youth 6%

| Age Group | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------|---------------------:|------------:|
| **Youth (15-29)** | **6.1%** (8/131) | 131 (7%) |
| Young Adult (30-44) | 13.4% (42/314) | 314 (17%) |
| Middle-aged (45-59) | 41.0% (234/571) | 571 (31%) |
| **Elderly (60+)** | **61.0%** (516/846) | 846 (46%) |

**Equity Gap:** 54.9 percentage points (Elderly vs Youth)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 282.6, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.39 (**MEDIUM effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- **46% of informal workers are elderly** (846 individuals)
- Elderly informal workers work out of necessity (no pension, inadequate elderly allowance)
- 61% chronic disease rate while working = forced to work despite illness
- Working with chronic disease in informal sector (no sick leave, no health insurance) creates health decline spiral

---

### 4. AGE & INCOME: 9,223 BAHT GAP (INVERTED PATTERN)
**Youth Earn More:** Young informal workers earn 9,223 baht more than elderly

| Age Group | Mean Income | Sample Size |
|-----------|------------:|------------:|
| **Youth (15-29)** | **19,408 baht** | 84 |
| Young Adult (30-44) | 18,795 baht | 255 |
| Middle-aged (45-59) | 17,315 baht | 414 |
| **Elderly (60+)** | **10,185 baht** | 628 |

**Equity Gap:** 9,223 baht/month (Youth vs Elderly)

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA F = 64.0, p < 0.001, Eta² = 0.12 (**MEDIUM effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- **Inverted age-income pattern:** Usually income increases with age/experience
- Youth informal workers earn MORE because they do high-skill gigs (delivery riders, online sellers)
- Elderly informal workers earn LESS because they do low-skill work (street vendors, cleaners)
- Elderly trapped in poverty wages (10,185 baht) with no retirement option

---

### 5. EDUCATION & INCOME: 6,337 BAHT GAP
**Education Still Matters:** High-education informal workers earn 6,337 baht more

| Education Level | Mean Income | Sample Size |
|-----------------|------------:|------------:|
| **Low** | 14,036 baht | 511 (44%) |
| Middle | 17,000 baht | 431 (34%) |
| **High** | 20,373 baht | 275 (22%) |

**Equity Gap:** 6,337 baht/month

**Statistical Test:** ANOVA F = 33.0, p < 0.001, Eta² = 0.05 (**SMALL effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- **44% have low education** (511 individuals) - majority
- Low-education informal workers trapped in lowest-paying work (14,036 baht)
- High-education informal workers leverage credentials even in informal sector (20,373 baht)
- Education can't fully overcome informal status (still 30% below formal workers)

---

### 6. DISABLED INFORMAL WORKERS: 14.5PP HIGHER HEALTHCARE BARRIERS
**Disability Penalty:** Disabled informal workers skip care at 28% vs non-disabled 13%

| Disability Status | Skip Medical Care (Cost) | Sample Size |
|-------------------|-------------------------:|------------:|
| **Disabled** | **27.8%** (20/72) | 72 (4%) |
| **Non-disabled** | **13.3%** (238/1,781) | 1,781 (96%) |

**Equity Gap:** 14.5 percentage points

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 10.3, p = 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.075 (**NEGLIGIBLE effect** but significant)

**Why It Matters:**
- **72 disabled informal workers** - triple burden (disability + informal + healthcare barriers)
- 28% skip care despite needing MORE healthcare than non-disabled
- No disability accommodations in informal sector
- Forced to work in informal sector because formal sector won't hire disabled

---

### 7. PARENTS & HEALTHCARE: 7.7PP GAP
**The Parent Penalty:** Informal workers with young children skip care at 21% vs non-parents 13%

| Has Children <5 | Skip Medical Care (Cost) | Sample Size |
|-----------------|-------------------------:|------------:|
| **Yes** | **20.8%** (35/168) | 168 (9%) |
| **No** | **13.2%** (223/1,685) | 1,685 (91%) |

**Equity Gap:** 7.7 percentage points

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 7.4, p = 0.006, Cramer's V = 0.063 (**NEGLIGIBLE effect** but significant)

**Why It Matters:**
- Parents prioritize children's needs over their own health
- Childcare costs + healthcare costs = impossible budget
- Must choose: doctor visit vs feeding children
- 168 informal worker parents face double burden

---

### 8. CHRONIC DISEASE BY EDUCATION: 25.6PP GAP
**Education Protects Health:** Low-education informal workers have 47% chronic disease vs high-education 21%

| Education Level | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|-----------------|---------------------:|------------:|
| **Low** | **47.2%** (387/820) | 820 |
| Middle | 30.9% (195/631) | 631 |
| **High** | **21.6%** (87/402) | 402 |

**Equity Gap:** 25.6 percentage points

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 95.7, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.23 (**SMALL effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- Low-education informal workers have DOUBLE the chronic disease rate
- Reflects lifetime poverty: poor nutrition, hazardous work, no preventive care
- High-education informal workers have better health literacy, safer work

---

### 9. HOMEOWNERSHIP & CHRONIC DISEASE: 14PP GAP
**Housing Reflects Health:** Renters have 43% chronic disease vs homeowners 29%

| Home Ownership | Chronic Disease Rate | Sample Size |
|----------------|---------------------:|------------:|
| **Renter** | **42.6%** (308/723) | 723 (39%) |
| Owner | 28.6% (171/599) | 599 (32%) |
| Other | 34.3% (185/540) | 540 (29%) |

**Equity Gap:** 14.0 percentage points (Renter vs Owner)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 30.9, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.13 (**SMALL effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- Homeowners = accumulated wealth, family support, health advantages
- Renters = poverty, stress, lower-quality living conditions
- Rent burden leaves no money for healthcare → chronic disease worsens

---

### 10. INCOME & DISABILITY: 5PP GAP
**Poverty Creates Disability:** Low-income informal workers have 7% disability vs high-income 2%

| Income Level | Disability Rate | Sample Size |
|--------------|----------------:|------------:|
| **Low** | **7.0%** (25/355) | 355 |
| Middle | 3.8% (23/604) | 604 |
| **High** | **2.1%** (9/422) | 422 |

**Equity Gap:** 5.0 percentage points

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 16.7, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.11 (**SMALL effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- Poverty causes disability: hazardous work, accidents, untreated illness
- Disability causes poverty: can only work informal jobs, earn less
- Vicious cycle: low income → disability → lower income

## Key Characteristics Driving Inequality

### Income Level (Low vs High) 💰
**Affects:** Healthcare access (26pp gap), disability (5pp), rent
**Impact:** Low-income earn below poverty, face catastrophic healthcare costs

### Age (Youth vs Elderly) 👴
**Affects:** Income (9,223 baht gap), chronic disease (55pp gap)
**Impact:** 46% are elderly - forced to work despite illness, earn poverty wages

### Education (Low vs High) 📚
**Affects:** Income (6,337 baht gap), chronic disease (26pp gap)
**Impact:** 44% low-education - trapped in lowest-paying, unhealthiest informal work

### Disability Status ♿
**Affects:** Healthcare access (15pp gap), income
**Impact:** 4% disabled (72 individuals) - triple burden, excluded from formal sector

### Home Ownership 🏠
**Affects:** Chronic disease (14pp gap), healthcare expenses
**Impact:** 39% renters - housing insecurity drives health insecurity

## The Informal Worker Paradox

### Despite Lower Income:
- **LOWER** food insecurity than formal workers (5.1% vs 13.6%)
- **LOWER** healthcare skipping than formal workers (13.3% vs 18.7%)
- **FEWER** work hours than formal workers (8 vs 9 hours)

### Why?
1. **Age effect:** 46% are elderly with family support (adult children provide food/housing)
2. **Household structure:** Many live with working family members who subsidize income
3. **Part-time work:** 63% work <8 hours (flexibility allows household tasks, reduces stress)
4. **Lower expectations:** Earn less but spend less (simpler lifestyle, no urban consumption pressure)

### But Still Face:
- **43% income penalty** vs formal workers
- **96% have NO benefits** (health insurance, sick leave, pension)
- **Zero legal protections** (contracts, minimum wage, labor law)
- **Massive internal inequities** (20,111 baht income gap within informal sector)

## Key Takeaways for Presentation

### The Story Arc:

1. **The Invisible Workforce:** 1,853 informal workers = street vendors, riders, cleaners, construction workers
2. **The Structural Gap:** 43% lower income, 96% NO benefits, 96% NO contracts
3. **The Internal Divide:** 20,111 baht income gap between richest and poorest informal workers
4. **The Age Crisis:** 46% are elderly working out of necessity (10,185 baht, 61% chronic disease)
5. **The Healthcare Trap:** Low-income informal workers skip care at 31% despite needing most help

### Powerful Statistics:

- **12,306 baht/month** income penalty (vs formal workers)
- **96%** have NO benefits (health insurance, pension, sick leave)
- **20,111 baht** income gap within informal sector
- **31%** of low-income skip medical care
- **46%** are elderly (846 individuals)
- **61%** of elderly have chronic disease while working
- **267%** income inequality (high vs low)

### The "So What?" Factor:

**Informal workers are NOT a homogeneous underclass.**

The informal sector contains:
- **Elderly working to survive** (10,185 baht/month, no pension)
- **Youth gig workers** earning middle-class wages (19,408 baht)
- **Disabled excluded from formal sector** (triple burden)
- **Parents choosing between doctor and children** (21% skip care)

**Current system offers zero protection:**
- No minimum wage
- No health insurance
- No sick leave
- No pension
- No contracts
- No legal recourse

**The solution requires comprehensive social protection:**
1. **Minimum income guarantee** - 15,000 baht/month floor
2. **Universal health coverage** - eliminate co-pays for informal workers
3. **Elderly support** - enhanced allowance for working elderly
4. **Formalization incentives** - pathways from informal to formal work

**The evidence is clear. The crisis is real. The solutions are feasible.**
