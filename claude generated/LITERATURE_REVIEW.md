# Chapter 2: Review of the Literature

## 2.1 Introduction

Health equity—the principle that everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential—has emerged as a critical priority in global public health (Braveman & Gruskin, 2003). Despite significant advances in healthcare technology and delivery, persistent disparities in health outcomes across social groups remain a defining challenge of the 21st century (Marmot et al., 2008). This literature review examines the theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and methodological approaches that inform our understanding of health inequities among vulnerable populations in urban settings, with particular attention to the Bangkok context.

This chapter is organized into seven sections: (1) the social determinants of health framework, (2) health equity research on vulnerable populations, (3) urban health disparities, (4) the Thai health system context, (5) methodological approaches in equity research, (6) data visualization and public engagement, and (7) gaps in existing literature that this study addresses.

## 2.2 Social Determinants of Health: Theoretical Framework

### 2.2.1 Core Concepts and Definitions

The social determinants of health (SDOH) framework posits that health outcomes are shaped not primarily by medical care, but by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008). These determinants operate at multiple levels—individual, community, and societal—and interact in complex ways to produce health inequities (Solar & Irwin, 2010).

Marmot and Wilkinson (2006) identified six key domains of social determinants: social gradient, stress, early life, social exclusion, work, and unemployment. Their seminal work demonstrated that health follows a social gradient: the lower one's socioeconomic position, the worse one's health outcomes. This gradient effect operates continuously across the entire socioeconomic spectrum, not merely between the poorest and everyone else (Adler et al., 1994).

### 2.2.2 Pathways from Social Position to Health Outcomes

Scholars have proposed several mechanisms through which social determinants influence health:

**Material pathways** involve direct effects of poverty, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and lack of access to healthcare (Lynch et al., 2000). These tangible deprivations create immediate health risks and limit opportunities for health-promoting behaviors.

**Psychosocial pathways** operate through chronic stress associated with low social status, discrimination, and social isolation (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2006). Prolonged exposure to psychosocial stressors triggers physiological responses—elevated cortisol, inflammation, dysregulated immune function—that increase disease risk (McEwen, 1998).

**Behavioral pathways** recognize that health behaviors are socially patterned. Smoking, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition cluster among disadvantaged groups not merely due to individual choices but because of constrained options shaped by social and economic circumstances (Pampel et al., 2010).

### 2.2.3 Critiques and Extensions

While the SDOH framework has gained widespread acceptance, critics note its tendency to underemphasize structural factors—political systems, economic policies, power relations—that produce inequitable distributions of resources and opportunities in the first place (Krieger, 2011). Ecosocial theory (Krieger, 2001) and fundamental cause theory (Link & Phelan, 1995) extend the framework by examining how power and resources enable advantaged groups to avoid health risks and adopt protective factors, thereby reproducing health inequalities even as specific diseases and risk factors change over time.

## 2.3 Health Equity Research on Vulnerable Populations

### 2.3.1 Elderly Populations

Demographic aging represents one of the most significant global transformations of the 21st century. By 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double, from 12% to 22% (WHO, 2022). This demographic shift presents profound challenges for health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries experiencing rapid aging.

Research consistently documents significant health inequities among older adults based on socioeconomic status, education, and access to resources. The "cumulative disadvantage" hypothesis suggests that inequalities accumulate over the life course, such that small initial differences in resources or opportunities compound into large disparities in later life (Dannefer, 2003). Studies from high-income countries show that educational attainment predicts not only longevity but also quality of life and functional independence in old age (Ross & Wu, 1996).

However, most aging research has focused on developed nations, leaving substantial gaps in understanding aging experiences in rapidly developing Asian contexts. Thailand's elderly population (aged 60+) increased from 10.7% in 2010 to 17.5% in 2020, with projections reaching 28% by 2040 (National Statistical Office Thailand, 2020). This rapid demographic transition has outpaced the development of comprehensive social support systems, creating vulnerabilities (Knodel & Chayovan, 2011).

Work by Prasitsiriphon and Pothisiri (2018) on Thai elderly found that those with lower education and income experienced significantly higher rates of chronic disease and functional limitations. Importantly, they identified "working poverty" among elderly as a distinct concern—many continue working not by choice but by economic necessity, often in informal sector jobs that provide neither retirement benefits nor occupational health protections.

### 2.3.2 LGBTQ+ Populations

Sexual and gender minority populations face substantial health disparities rooted in stigma, discrimination, and minority stress (Meyer, 2003). The minority stress model posits that LGBTQ+ individuals experience excess stress due to (1) external stressors such as discrimination and violence, (2) expectations of rejection and need for vigilance, and (3) internalized homophobia/transphobia (Hendricks & Testa, 2012).

Meta-analyses document elevated rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidality among LGBTQ+ populations compared to heterosexual/cisgender peers (King et al., 2008; Marshal et al., 2011). These disparities persist even after controlling for socioeconomic factors, suggesting unique stressors associated with sexual/gender minority status (Cochran et al., 2003).

Healthcare access represents a critical concern. Studies from the United States and Europe show that LGBTQ+ individuals delay or avoid healthcare due to fear of discrimination, previous negative experiences, or provider ignorance about their health needs (Macapagal et al., 2016). This "healthcare avoidance" phenomenon creates cascading health risks as treatable conditions go unaddressed.

Research on LGBTQ+ health in Thailand remains limited despite the country's reputation for relative tolerance. While Thailand lacks explicit anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, substantial social stigma persists (UNDP & USAID, 2014). Preliminary studies suggest Thai LGBTQ+ individuals face discrimination in employment, healthcare, and family contexts (Ojanen et al., 2016). However, large-scale quantitative research examining multiple health outcomes across intersecting identities (e.g., elderly LGBTQ+ individuals) is notably absent.

### 2.3.3 Persons with Disabilities

The WHO estimates that 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability, with higher prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (WHO & World Bank, 2011). Persons with disabilities experience worse health outcomes, lower educational attainment, reduced economic participation, and higher poverty rates compared to people without disabilities (Emerson et al., 2009).

The social model of disability, articulated by Oliver (1990), distinguishes between impairment (functional limitation) and disability (social disadvantage resulting from barriers in the environment). This framework shifts focus from individual deficits to societal barriers—inaccessible buildings, discriminatory policies, attitudinal prejudices—that disable people with impairments.

Healthcare access represents a particular challenge. Persons with disabilities face multiple barriers: physical inaccessibility of facilities, provider attitudes and lack of training, communication barriers, and inability to afford care or assistive devices (Iezzoni et al., 2021). Paradoxically, despite having greater healthcare needs, they often receive less preventive care and poorer quality treatment (Mitra et al., 2017).

In Thailand, the 2007 Persons with Disabilities Empowerment Act provides legal protections and entitles registered persons with disabilities to a 800 baht/month allowance, free assistive devices, and preferential access to certain services (Singhariya & Moersalin, 2021). However, implementation gaps persist. Research by Rungnapakan et al. (2019) found that many eligible individuals remain unregistered due to stigma or lack of awareness, and those with disabilities in rural areas face greater challenges accessing services than urban counterparts.

### 2.3.4 Informal Workers

Informal employment—work outside formal labor regulations, lacking social protections such as health insurance, sick leave, or retirement benefits—accounts for approximately 60% of global employment (ILO, 2018). In developing countries, informal work often represents the only livelihood option for those lacking education, capital, or social connections to access formal employment.

Health research on informal workers documents a "double jeopardy": poor working conditions (occupational hazards, long hours, income instability) combined with inadequate healthcare access (Benach et al., 2014). Street vendors, construction laborers, domestic workers, and gig economy participants often work while sick due to inability to afford income loss, perpetuating illness and spreading communicable diseases (Osterholm, 2005).

Thailand's informal sector comprised 55.2% of total employment in 2020 (ILO, 2021). While the country achieved universal health coverage through three schemes (Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, Social Security Scheme, and Universal Coverage Scheme), informal workers primarily rely on the Universal Coverage Scheme, which provides comprehensive services but with longer wait times and more limited provider choice compared to formal sector schemes (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2018).

Research by Jirojwong and Manderson (2001) on Thai informal workers found that despite nominal universal coverage, structural barriers—inability to take time off work, transportation costs, facility locations—effectively limited healthcare utilization. More recent work by Thammatacharee et al. (2019) confirmed that informal workers use preventive services at substantially lower rates than formal workers, despite higher disease burdens.

## 2.4 Urban Health Disparities

### 2.4.1 The Urban Health Paradox

Cities offer proximity to healthcare facilities, economic opportunities, and health-promoting infrastructure, yet they also concentrate poverty, environmental hazards, and social inequalities (Vlahov & Galea, 2002). This "urban health paradox" means that while average health indicators may appear favorable in cities, they mask extreme disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged urban residents (Lilford et al., 2017).

Neighborhood effects research demonstrates that health outcomes vary substantially within cities based on area-level characteristics: poverty concentration, food environments, built environment quality, social cohesion, and violence (Diez Roux & Mair, 2010). These contextual factors influence health both directly (e.g., air pollution exposure) and indirectly by shaping health behaviors and psychosocial stress (Ross & Mirowsky, 2001).

### 2.4.2 Bangkok's Urban Health Landscape

Bangkok, Thailand's capital and largest city, exemplifies rapid urbanization characteristic of Southeast Asian megacities. The city's population of 10.7 million (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, 2020) includes substantial internal migration from rural areas seeking economic opportunities. This influx has created a highly heterogeneous population with vast disparities in wealth, education, and living conditions across Bangkok's 50 districts.

Research on Bangkok's health geography reveals significant spatial inequalities. Poungsomlee and Ross (1992) documented stark contrasts between affluent central districts with abundant healthcare facilities and peripheral districts where low-income migrants concentrate with limited access to services. More recent spatial analysis by Khamman et al. (2019) found that while Bangkok has Thailand's highest density of hospitals and physicians per capita, distribution is highly uneven, with wealthy districts having 10-15 times more private specialists than poorer areas.

Environmental health disparities also pattern along socioeconomic lines. Phuanukoonnon et al. (2013) found that flood vulnerability, air pollution exposure, and heat island effects disproportionately affect low-income Bangkok neighborhoods with inadequate infrastructure. These environmental injustices compound baseline health vulnerabilities.

## 2.5 Thai Health System Context

### 2.5.1 Universal Health Coverage Achievement

Thailand achieved universal health coverage (UHC) in 2002 with implementation of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), also known as the "30-baht scheme" for its initial nominal co-payment (later eliminated in 2006) (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2015). This achievement placed Thailand among the first middle-income countries to provide comprehensive health coverage to all citizens.

The Thai health system operates through three main schemes:
- **Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS)**: Covers government employees and dependents (~8% of population)
- **Social Security Scheme (SSS)**: Covers formal private sector employees (~15% of population)
- **Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)**: Covers remaining citizens (~75% of population)

Evaluations of UHC impacts show substantial reductions in catastrophic health expenditure and improved financial protection, particularly for the poor (Limwattananon et al., 2015). However, persistent inequities remain across the three schemes in quality of care, provider choice, and access to advanced treatments (Prakongsai et al., 2009).

### 2.5.2 Remaining Equity Challenges

Despite UHC, several equity challenges persist:

**Geographic disparities**: Rural and remote areas face physician shortages and facility limitations, despite policies attempting redistribution (Wibulpolprasert & Pengpaibon, 2003). Even within Bangkok, as noted above, facility distribution favors wealthy areas.

**Scheme-based inequities**: The CSMBS, which operates on a fee-for-service model with no gatekeeping and free choice of providers including private hospitals, provides substantially more generous benefits than the capitation-based UCS, which restricts beneficiaries to designated primary care units (Yiengprugsawan et al., 2010). This creates a "two-tier" system where equity in coverage does not translate to equity in access or quality.

**Out-of-pocket expenses**: Despite UHC, out-of-pocket spending remains significant (11% of total health expenditure in 2018), driven by excluded services, preference for private providers, and under-the-table payments (WHO, 2020). These costs disproportionately burden low-income households.

**Prevention vs. treatment focus**: The UCS emphasizes primary care and treatment services, with less emphasis on population-level prevention and health promotion, particularly for non-communicable diseases (Tangcharoensathien et al., 2020). This limits the system's ability to address upstream social determinants.

## 2.6 Methodological Approaches in Health Equity Research

### 2.6.1 Measuring Health Inequities

Health equity research requires methods that can identify disparities across social groups and quantify their magnitude. Several approaches have been developed:

**Stratified descriptive analysis** involves disaggregating health outcomes by socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, gender, or other equity-relevant stratifiers to reveal disparities (Harper & Lynch, 2007). While straightforward, this approach powerfully demonstrates that health is socially patterned.

**Regression-based approaches** adjust for confounders to isolate the independent association between social position and health outcomes (Kaufman et al., 2004). However, critiques note that "adjusting away" social factors may obscure rather than clarify the mechanisms producing inequities (Kaufman & Cooper, 2001).

**Concentration indices and curves** summarize the extent to which health outcomes are concentrated among the poor or rich (Wagstaff et al., 1991). These measures, borrowed from economics, provide single summary statistics for monitoring equity trends over time.

**Spatial analysis** examines geographic patterns of health outcomes to identify "hot spots" of poor health and their associations with area-level characteristics (Fotheringham & Rogerson, 2009). Geographic information systems (GIS) enable visualization of how health inequities manifest across physical space.

### 2.6.2 Effect Size Measures

A key methodological development in equity research involves supplementing statistical significance testing (p-values) with effect size measures that quantify the magnitude of disparities (Sullivan & Feinn, 2012). For categorical outcomes analyzed via chi-square tests, Cramér's V provides a standardized measure of association strength (Cramér, 1946). For continuous outcomes analyzed via ANOVA, eta-squared (η²) quantifies the proportion of variance explained by group membership (Cohen, 1988).

These effect size measures allow researchers to distinguish between statistically significant but trivial differences (common in large samples) and substantial disparities that warrant policy attention. Guidelines from Cohen (1988) and subsequent refinements suggest general thresholds for small, medium, and large effects, though interpretation should consider practical significance in specific contexts.

### 2.6.3 Benchmarking Approaches

Health equity research increasingly employs benchmarking to set achievable targets for reducing disparities. Two main approaches exist:

**External benchmarking** compares outcomes to international standards or best-performing countries. For example, WHO guidelines provide target ratios for healthcare workforce density (44.5 physicians per 10,000 population) that serve as benchmarks for evaluating national performance (WHO, 2016).

**Internal benchmarking** identifies the best-performing subgroup within the study population and calculates how much the rest of the population would improve if they achieved that level (Keppel et al., 2005). This approach has particular appeal for equity research because it demonstrates that observed disparities are not inevitable—some group already achieves better outcomes, proving that improvement is possible given appropriate resources and conditions.

## 2.7 Data Visualization and Public Engagement

### 2.7.1 The Gap Between Research and Impact

A persistent challenge in health equity research involves the disconnect between academic findings and policy action. Complex statistical analyses, published in specialized journals, often fail to reach policymakers, practitioners, or affected communities (Lavis et al., 2003). This "translation gap" limits the real-world impact of equity research.

Scholars increasingly recognize that how research findings are communicated matters as much as the rigor of the analysis itself (Brownson et al., 2009). Effective translation requires multiple strategies: policy briefs that synthesize key findings for non-technical audiences, stakeholder engagement to ensure research addresses practical questions, and innovative presentation formats that make data accessible and compelling (Nutley et al., 2007).

### 2.7.2 Interactive Dashboards for Health Data

The rise of data visualization technologies has created new opportunities for engaging broader audiences with health equity findings. Interactive dashboards—web-based platforms that allow users to explore data through maps, charts, and filters—represent a particularly promising approach (Carroll et al., 2014).

Effective health dashboards share several characteristics (Dowding et al., 2015):
- **Accessibility**: Web-based platforms require no specialized software
- **Interactivity**: Users can filter, zoom, and explore data of interest to them
- **Visual clarity**: Charts and maps communicate patterns more intuitively than tables of numbers
- **Contextual information**: Annotations and explanations help users interpret what they see
- **Actionability**: Data presentations connect to concrete recommendations for improvement

Public health agencies in several countries have developed equity dashboards. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings (remapped.org) provides interactive maps and rankings of U.S. counties on multiple health outcomes and determinants. The UK's Public Health England developed the "Public Health Outcomes Framework" dashboard allowing exploration of health indicators across geographic areas and population groups (fingertips.phe.org.uk).

### 2.7.3 Limitations and Considerations

While dashboards offer significant potential, several cautions apply:

**Data quality dependencies**: Dashboards are only as good as their underlying data. Incomplete coverage, measurement errors, or biased sampling can mislead users if not clearly acknowledged (Few, 2006).

**Interpretation challenges**: Interactive exploration may lead users to over-interpret patterns, particularly if they lack statistical training to distinguish signal from noise (Tufte, 2001).

**Equity of access**: Digital dashboards assume internet access and digital literacy, potentially excluding the very populations most affected by health inequities from accessing information about their communities (Viswanath & Kreuter, 2007).

Despite these limitations, thoughtfully designed dashboards represent a valuable complement to traditional research dissemination, expanding the reach and impact of health equity findings.

## 2.8 Gaps in Existing Literature

While the literature reviewed above provides essential foundations, several significant gaps remain:

### 2.8.1 Limited Research on Intersectionality

Most health equity research examines single dimensions of disadvantage—poverty OR race OR disability—but people experience multiple, intersecting forms of marginalization simultaneously (Bauer, 2014). For example, elderly LGBTQ+ individuals or disabled informal workers may face compounded disadvantages that differ qualitatively from the sum of individual risk factors. Quantitative research operationalizing intersectionality remains methodologically challenging and underrepresented (Bauer & Scheim, 2019).

### 2.8.2 Insufficient Focus on Within-Group Inequities

Equity research often compares vulnerable populations to the general population, documenting that (for example) disabled individuals have worse health outcomes than non-disabled people. However, substantial inequities exist within vulnerable populations themselves—not all elderly or LGBTQ+ or disabled people face identical circumstances. Research revealing within-group heterogeneity and identifying the most marginalized subgroups remains limited (Gkiouleka et al., 2018).

### 2.8.3 Lack of Bangkok-Specific Equity Research

Despite Bangkok's status as Southeast Asia's second-largest urban agglomeration and Thailand's economic and political center, comprehensive health equity research specific to Bangkok is surprisingly scarce. Most Thai health research either focuses on national-level patterns or examines specific provinces, leaving Bangkok's unique urban dynamics underexplored. The few Bangkok-focused studies tend to examine single health outcomes or specific populations, lacking comprehensive assessment across multiple health domains and vulnerable groups.

### 2.8.4 Limited Accessible Data Platforms

While Thailand's health data systems are relatively strong by middle-income country standards, publicly accessible platforms allowing researchers, policymakers, and communities to explore health equity patterns remain underdeveloped. This limits transparency, hinders independent research, and prevents communities from understanding health patterns in their own districts.

### 2.8.5 Insufficient Connection to Actionable Recommendations

Much health equity research documents disparities in great detail but provides limited guidance on concrete interventions to address them. The gap between "diagnosis" (identifying inequities) and "prescription" (proposing evidence-based solutions) limits the practical utility of equity research for policymakers facing resource constraints and competing priorities (Whitehead, 2007).

## 2.9 Contribution of the Current Study

This study addresses the identified gaps through several innovations:

**Comprehensive multi-population analysis**: Rather than examining a single vulnerable population, this research analyzes health equity patterns across four groups—elderly, LGBTQ+, persons with disabilities, and informal workers—allowing examination of both between-group differences and within-group inequities.

**Bangkok-specific focus**: By concentrating on Bangkok's 50 districts, this research provides the first comprehensive district-level analysis of health equity patterns in Thailand's capital, revealing spatial inequities and identifying high-priority areas for intervention.

**Multiple health domains**: Rather than focusing on a single outcome, the analysis examines 60+ indicators across six domains: demographics, healthcare access, health outcomes, health behaviors, healthcare supply, and economic factors. This breadth enables understanding of how inequities manifest across different aspects of health and wellbeing.

**Methodological rigor with accessibility**: The study employs rigorous statistical methods (chi-square tests, ANOVA, effect size measures) while presenting findings through an accessible interactive dashboard, bridging the gap between academic research and public engagement.

**Actionable recommendations**: The research explicitly connects empirical findings to concrete policy recommendations with estimated costs and implementation considerations, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

**Internal benchmarking approach**: By identifying best-performing districts and calculating "achievable benchmarks," the research demonstrates that reducing inequities is feasible, not utopian, as some Bangkok districts already achieve better outcomes.

The following chapters present the methodology, findings, and recommendations emerging from this comprehensive health equity analysis.
