# LGBTQ+ Equity Report: Executive Summary
## Bangkok Health Survey - Key Findings for Presentation

**Sample:** 685 LGBTQ+ individuals from Bangkok (compared to 5,838 general population)
**Method:** Part 1 - Comparison with general population | Part 2 - Equity within LGBTQ+ community
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

---

### 4. MEDICAL CARE BARRIERS: 2.2X HIGHER DESPITE HIGHER INCOME
**The Healthcare Paradox:** 28.8% of LGBTQ+ skip medical care due to cost vs 13.4% general

| Population | Skip Medical Care (Cost) | Sample Size |
|------------|-------------------------:|------------:|
| **LGBTQ+** | **28.8%** (197/685) | 685 |
| **General** | **13.4%** (784/5,838) | 5,838 |

**Gap:** +15.4 percentage points (**2.2x higher**)

**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001, highly significant

**Context:** LGBTQ+ earn 11.5% MORE than general population (25,369 vs 22,750 baht/month) yet skip care at higher rates

**Why It Matters:**
- Higher income doesn't protect against healthcare barriers
- LGBTQ+-specific barriers: discrimination by providers, lack of LGBTQ+-competent care, fear of outing

| **LGBTQ+** | **20.0%** (137/685) | 685 |
| **General** | **7.9%** (462/5,838) | 5,838 |

**Gap:** +12.1 percentage points (**2.5x higher**)

**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001, highly significant

**Context:**
- LGBTQ+ work MORE hours (9.0 vs 8.6 hours/day)
- LGBTQ+ have HIGHER employment rate (74% vs 62%)
- LGBTQ+ earn MORE income (25,369 vs 22,750 baht)

**Why It Matters:**
- **1 in 5 LGBTQ+ individuals** go hungry despite working more and earning more
- Higher rent consumes income (8,567 vs 7,010 baht = +22% rent burden)
- Family rejection means no safety net or food support from relatives
- Hunger impacts health, work performance, mental health

**Policy Impact:**
- Food assistance programs specifically for LGBTQ+ individuals
- Rent subsidies to reduce housing cost burden
- Emergency food banks in LGBTQ+ community centers
- Address discrimination in housing to reduce rent burden

---

### 6. SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY: 2.8X HIGHER (SKIP FULL DAYS)
**Extreme Hunger:** 13.0% of LGBTQ+ skip entire days of meals vs 4.7% general

| Population | Skip Full Day of Meals | Sample Size |
|------------|------------------------:|------------:|
| **LGBTQ+** | **13.0%** (89/685) | 685 |
| **General** | **4.7%** (274/5,838) | 5,838 |

**Gap:** -11.9 percentage points (**14% lower**)

**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001, highly significant

**Why It Matters:**
- LGBTQ+ individuals are **rejected or forced out** by families
- Loss of family support creates vulnerability: no housing safety net, no financial help, no emotional support
- Must rent alone → higher rent burden → food insecurity
- Contributes to violence (no family protection) and mental health crisis

**Policy Impact:**
- Family counseling and reconciliation services for LGBTQ+ youth
- Affordable housing programs for LGBTQ+ individuals without family support

- Creates cascading crises (can't get to hospital, can't flee violence, can't pay rent)

---

### 9. EMPLOYMENT PARADOX: BETTER JOBS BUT NOT SAFER
**The Success Story with a Dark Side:** LGBTQ+ have 59% more contracts, 58% more benefits, work 20% more

| Metric | LGBTQ+ | General Population | Gap |
|--------|-------:|-------------------:|----:|
| **Has employment contract** | 53.7% | 33.7% | **+20.0 pp** |

**Interpretation:**
- LGBTQ+ must work harder to overcome discrimination (need formal credentials)
- Higher education (54% high-education vs 35% general) drives better jobs
- But workplace discrimination persists (violence, injury)
- Income consumed by higher rent (22% more) due to housing discrimination

**Gap:** +6.3 percentage points (**25% higher**)

**Statistical Test:** p < 0.001, highly significant

**Why It Matters:**
- Oral health often neglected due to cost (dental care expensive, not covered)

---

### 3. RENTERS SKIP MEDICAL CARE 73% MORE
**Housing & Health Link:** LGBTQ+ renters skip care at 32.6% vs homeowners 18.8%

| Home Ownership | Skip Medical Care | Sample Size |
|----------------|------------------:|------------:|

| Owner | 18.8% (19/101) | 101 |

**Gap:** 13.8 percentage points (**73% higher**)

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square = 9.6, p = 0.008, Cramer's V = 0.12 (**small effect**)

**Why It Matters:**
- LGBTQ+ renters face double burden: rent costs + healthcare costs
- Homeownership represents wealth accumulation + family support
- Renters often rejected by family → forced to rent → less money for healthcare

---

### 4. PARENTS FACE 43% MORE VIOLENCE
**The Parent Penalty:** LGBTQ+ parents experience 33.8% psychological violence vs 23.6% non-parents

| Has Young Children | Psychological Violence | Sample Size |

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square test, p < 0.001

**Why It Matters:**
- Low-income LGBTQ+ work informal jobs (no benefits, no protection)
- High-income LGBTQ+ work formal sector (contracts, health insurance, leave)
- Creates health and safety divide within LGBTQ+ community

## Summary: The LGBTQ+ Paradox

### The Success Story:
- **Higher education:** 54% high-education vs 35% general
- **Better employment:** 74% working vs 62% general
- **Higher income:** 25,369 vs 22,750 baht (+11.5%)
- **Formal jobs:** 54% have contracts vs 34% general (+59%)
- **Work benefits:** 54% have benefits vs 34% general (+58%)

### The Crisis:
- **Physical violence:** 13.1% vs 2.6% general (**5.1x higher**)
- **Psychological violence:** 29.2% vs 7.9% general (**3.7x higher**)
- **Sexual violence:** 4.7% vs 1.1% general (**4.3x higher**)
- **Skip medical care:** 28.8% vs 13.4% general (**2.2x higher**)
- **Food insecurity:** 20.0% vs 7.9% general (**2.5x higher**)
- **Family rejection:** 72.8% vs 84.7% live with family (**-12 pp**)
- **No emergency support:** 17.4% vs 8.7% have no one (**2x higher**)

### The Paradox Explained:
1. **Discrimination persists despite success:** Education and income cannot protect against violence, healthcare discrimination, family rejection
2. **Higher costs consume higher income:** 22% higher rent + family rejection = food insecurity despite earning more
3. **Must work harder to survive:** LGBTQ+ need formal credentials to overcome hiring discrimination, work 9 hours/day to afford high rent
4. **Social isolation creates vulnerability:** Family rejection + no safety net = cascading crises when violence/illness/job loss occurs
5. **Internal inequality:** Low-income LGBTQ+ face triple burden (discrimination + poverty + violence), while high-income LGBTQ+ protected by wealth

## Key Takeaways for Presentation

### The Story Arc:

1. **The Paradox:** LGBTQ+ individuals are more educated, work more, earn more, have better jobs
2. **The Crisis:** Yet face 3-5x higher rates of violence, healthcare barriers, food insecurity
3. **The Explanation:** Discrimination persists despite success; family rejection creates vulnerability
4. **The Internal Divide:** Low-income LGBTQ+ face triple burden (discrimination + poverty + violence)
5. **The Solution:** Comprehensive anti-discrimination law + targeted support services

### Powerful Statistics:

- **5.1x** physical violence (13.1% vs 2.6%)
- **3.7x** psychological violence (29.2% vs 7.9%)
- **4.3x** sexual violence (4.7% vs 1.1%)
- **2.2x** skip medical care (28.8% vs 13.4%)
- **2.5x** food insecurity (20.0% vs 7.9%)
- **22%** higher rent burden (8,567 vs 7,010 baht)
- **1 in 5** LGBTQ+ go hungry despite working more

### The "So What?" Factor:

**Success cannot protect against discrimination.**

LGBTQ+ individuals work harder, earn more, and achieve more - yet still face:
- Violence in homes, workplaces, streets
- Healthcare providers who discriminate
- Families who reject them
- Landlords who charge more
- Society that tolerates violence

**The solution requires both:**
1. **Anti-discrimination enforcement** - Stop the violence and discrimination
2. **Targeted support services** - Help those already harmed by rejection and violence

**The evidence is clear. The crisis is real. The solutions are feasible.**
