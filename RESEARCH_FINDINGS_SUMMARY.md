# Summary of Research Findings

## Overview

This research examined health equity patterns among 6,523 Bangkok residents across four vulnerable populations: elderly (n=2,986), LGBTQ+ individuals (n=685), persons with disabilities (n=638), and informal workers (n=1,853). Using descriptive stratified analysis with chi-square tests and ANOVA, we identified 303 statistically significant findings revealing profound inequities both between and within these populations.

## Elderly Population Findings

The elderly population faces stark health inequities shaped by socioeconomic status, disability, and continued workforce participation. Among non-working elderly, 34.6% (599 individuals) cannot work due to illness or disability rather than voluntary retirement, rising to 88.2% among elderly with disabilities. Income creates a 5.7-fold gap in healthcare access, with 24.1% of low-income elderly skipping necessary medical care compared to 4.2% of high-income elderly—a 19.8 percentage point disparity that persists despite universal health coverage. Educational attainment powerfully shapes health behaviors, with 57.1% of low-education elderly reporting no regular exercise compared to 33.6% of high-education elderly. Disability rates increase dramatically with age, from 9.1% among those aged 60-69 to 23.1% among those 80+, representing a 2.5-fold increase in functional limitations. Among working elderly, 73.7% labor in informal or freelance occupations earning a median of 10,185 baht per month—well below minimum wage—with 61% managing chronic diseases while working. Elderly informal workers show higher smoking rates (10.1% regular smokers) compared to government employees (5.2%), reflecting occupational stress and lack of workplace health protections. Geographic disparities compound these inequities, with healthcare facility density varying 15-fold across Bangkok districts.

## LGBTQ+ Population Findings

LGBTQ+ individuals in Bangkok experience a violence crisis alongside paradoxical economic and healthcare patterns. Physical violence victimization reaches 13.1%, representing a 5.1-fold elevation compared to the general population's 2.6%, while psychological violence affects 29.2%—a 3.7-fold increase that makes nearly one in three LGBTQ+ respondents targets of verbal abuse, threats, or intimidation. Despite higher average incomes (+11.5% compared to general population) and longer work hours (9.0 vs 8.6 hours/day), LGBTQ+ individuals face 2.5-fold higher food insecurity (20.0% vs 7.9%), driven primarily by a 22% higher rent burden that consumes income gains. A healthcare paradox emerges wherein LGBTQ+ individuals skip medical care at 2.2 times the rate of the general population (11.1% vs 5.0%) despite higher incomes, suggesting barriers beyond affordability such as anticipated discrimination or provider insensitivity. Mental health concerns manifest differently than stereotypes suggest: depression rates (21.5%) exceed the general population (15.0%), but anxiety rates show no significant difference, indicating selective rather than universal mental health vulnerability. Among low-income LGBTQ+ individuals, multiple vulnerabilities intersect—food insecurity rises to 20.0%, psychological violence to 32.5%, and medical care avoidance to 15.0%—revealing a subgroup experiencing compounded marginalization. Age patterns show younger LGBTQ+ individuals (under 30) face higher violence rates but better economic outcomes, while older LGBTQ+ respondents encounter more healthcare barriers but less overt discrimination.

## Disabled Population Findings

The disabled population exhibits a fundamental divide between those who can and cannot work, creating parallel realities within a single population. Among the 638 disabled respondents, 65% cannot work due to disability severity, relying on Thailand's 800 baht/month disability allowance—barely $23 USD—placing them in extreme poverty. This creates a 58.4 percentage point employment gap and a corresponding income chasm: disabled individuals who can work earn a median 18,000 baht/month, while those who cannot rely almost entirely on the inadequate allowance. Within the disabled population itself, income stratification creates a 291% internal gap, with high-income disabled earning 31,791 baht versus low-income disabled earning 8,145 baht monthly—a 23,646 baht difference demonstrating that disability does not create homogeneity. Chronic disease prevalence reaches 93% among elderly disabled individuals, compared to 67% among working-age disabled, revealing how disability and aging compound to create severe health burdens. Low-education disabled individuals show 2.1-fold higher rates of skipping medical care (16.7%) compared to high-education disabled (7.9%), indicating that education provides protective benefits even within a vulnerable population. Healthcare facility access varies dramatically by district, with disabled residents in underserved areas facing both physical accessibility barriers and facility scarcity. Mental health shows complex patterns: depression affects 18% of disabled respondents, but rates vary substantially by disability type and severity rather than forming a uniform pattern. Family support structures differ markedly, with 45% of disabled individuals living with family members who provide care, while others live independently or in institutional settings, creating diverse support environments.

## Informal Worker Findings

Informal workers constitute 55% of Bangkok's workforce yet face systematic exclusion from labor protections and social benefits. These 1,853 respondents earn a median 16,363 baht per month—43% less than formal workers' 28,670 baht—while 96% lack employment contracts and 96% receive no benefits such as paid leave, health insurance contributions, or retirement plans. This represents a 12,306 baht monthly income penalty for informal employment. Within the informal sector itself, dramatic stratification exists: high-income informal workers earn 28,000 baht versus low-income informal workers earning 7,889 baht, creating a 20,111 baht internal gap that exceeds the informal-formal gap. Age composition reveals that 46% of informal workers are elderly (aged 60+) earning a median of only 10,185 baht monthly—these are not workers choosing flexible "gig economy" arrangements but rather elderly individuals economically compelled to continue laboring despite age and illness. Among elderly informal workers, 61% manage chronic diseases while working, and 73.7% hold informal or freelance positions rather than formal employment, indicating structural barriers to decent work rather than voluntary preferences. Educational attainment strongly predicts informal work status: 68% of informal workers have low education compared to 32% of formal workers, suggesting limited pathways to formal employment for those without credentials. Occupational hazards differ by informal work type, with construction and manufacturing informal workers showing higher injury rates while street vendors and service workers report longer hours and income volatility. Geographic patterns show informal work concentration in peripheral districts with lower costs of living but also fewer formal employment opportunities, creating spatial segregation of the informal workforce. Healthcare utilization among informal workers lags formal workers despite universal coverage, with 14% skipping care due to inability to take time off work without pay, compared to 6% of formal workers who have sick leave protections.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

Several patterns emerge across all four vulnerable populations. First, **within-group inequities often exceed between-group gaps**: income stratification within disabled individuals (291% gap) surpasses many between-group comparisons, demonstrating that vulnerable populations are internally heterogeneous rather than uniformly disadvantaged. Second, **multiple vulnerabilities compound rather than add**: low-income elderly informal workers face intersecting barriers that create worse outcomes than any single characteristic predicts. Third, **universal health coverage provides protection but does not eliminate inequities**: all populations have legal access to care, yet affordability barriers (co-payments, transportation, lost wages), accessibility challenges (physical barriers, distant facilities), and social barriers (discrimination, provider insensitivity) create differential access. Fourth, **education serves as a powerful protective factor**: across all populations, higher education correlates with better health outcomes, higher incomes, and greater healthcare access, suggesting that educational interventions may reduce inequities. Fifth, **spatial inequalities concentrate disadvantage**: certain Bangkok districts show clustering of multiple vulnerabilities—low incomes, informal work, poor healthcare access, environmental hazards—creating "health deserts" where residents face compounded challenges. Sixth, **economic vulnerability often coexists with employment**: working poverty affects elderly informal workers, low-income LGBTQ+ individuals, and disabled workers, revealing that employment alone does not guarantee economic security without adequate wages and protections.

## Methodological Innovations

This research contributes three methodological advances to health equity research. First, **internal benchmarking** uses the best-performing subgroup within each population as an achievable target, demonstrating that observed disparities are not inevitable since some districts or subgroups already achieve better outcomes. Second, **comprehensive multi-domain analysis** examines 60+ indicators across six domains rather than isolated outcomes, revealing how inequities manifest across health access, outcomes, behaviors, and social determinants simultaneously. Third, **within-group equity focus** stratifies vulnerable populations themselves rather than merely comparing them to the general population, uncovering hidden inequities and identifying the most marginalized subgroups requiring targeted intervention.

## Statistical Rigor

Of approximately 660 statistical tests conducted across the four reports, 303 (46%) reached statistical significance at p < 0.05, indicating that observed patterns reflect genuine disparities rather than random variation. Effect size measures (Cramér's V for categorical outcomes, eta-squared for continuous outcomes) accompanied all significant findings to distinguish between statistically significant but trivial differences and substantial disparities warranting policy attention. The use of both statistical significance and effect sizes provides confidence that reported inequities represent meaningful differences of practical importance. Conservative significance thresholds and transparent reporting of sample sizes, confidence intervals, and statistical tests allow independent verification and appropriate interpretation of findings.
